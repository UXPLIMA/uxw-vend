/**
 * A module reads its own tables, and asks for everything else.
 *
 * Modules never import each other, and the panel has a gate for that. The
 * merged Prisma client is the hole in it: every installed module's models sit
 * on one client, so a module can read another's tables without importing a
 * line of its code. Five did. The leaderboard queried the shop's `Order`, the
 * forum's `ForumPost` and the vote module's `VoteLog`, guarding each with a
 * "is this model here?" check - which is a module knowing the name of a table
 * it does not own and the shape of a feature it does not ship. Two invoicing
 * modules read `Order` the same way. The referral module wrote rows into the
 * shop's `CreditTransaction`.
 *
 * It is the wrong direction. A base module owns a concept and opens a socket;
 * the specific module plugs into it. The store already does this with
 * `server.command`: it asks whether anybody can run a command on a game
 * server, and the module that can answers. It does not know what RCON is.
 *
 * What a hook costs is a declaration; what a cross-module read costs is a
 * module that cannot be uninstalled without breaking another one, silently,
 * at runtime.
 *
 * Core's tables are not in scope: reaching core is what the SDK is for.
