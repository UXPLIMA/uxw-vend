/**
 * Which address in a forwarded chain is the caller.
 *
 * `x-forwarded-for` is a list, and a proxy appends to its right: nginx's
 * `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` and Caddy both add the peer they saw to the
 * end, so everything left of that is whatever the caller chose to send.
 * Reading `split(",")[0]` reads the caller's own text, which is the classic
 * way a forwarded header gets trusted by mistake, and it made
 * `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` mean less than its name says: with a real chain, the
 * entry it vouched for was not the entry that got used.
 *
 * Everything keys on this. Rate limits key on it, so a spoofable answer means
 * rotating one header buys a fresh budget; the IP blocklist keys on it, so a
 * blocked address is evaded by typing a different one. There are forty-three
 * callers of `getClientIP`.
