/**
 * An answer that is the same for everybody says how long it may be kept.
 *
 * A public page asks for eleven things before it has drawn anything, and most
 * of those answers are identical for every visitor: the site's currency, the
 * announcements, the Discord server id, the SEO record for a path. Two
 * endpoints already said so with `s-maxage`; eight said nothing, so every
 * visitor's request travelled to the origin and ran the query again.
 *
 * `s-maxage` speaks to shared caches and not to browsers, which is the point:
 * a proxy in front of the site may hold the answer for thirty seconds, and no
 * visitor's own cache is involved.
 *
 * That is also what makes the second half of this test a security rule rather
 * than a tidiness one. An answer that varies by who asked must never carry it:
 * the blog list and the slider both show an administrator what is not
 * published yet, and one shared cache entry would hand that to the next
 * anonymous reader. They are named here so it stays deliberate.
