/**
 * A stylesheet this app ships does not go and fetch another one.
 *
 * `@measured/puck`'s stylesheet opens with
 * `@import "https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css"`, and it reaches public pages
 * through the module that renders a built page. Every first visit fetched a
 * stranger's stylesheet and three font files from it, on top of the Inter
 * this app already self hosts and, at the time, never used.
 *
 * The visible cost was movement. The remote copy registers under the same
 * family name, arrives after paint and is around ten percent wider than the
 * fallback, which was enough to wrap the navigation onto a second row.
 * Measured over a production build, nine public pages carried 0.05 to 0.12
 * of layout shift against a 0.1 budget, and cart carried 0.12.
 *
 * The build now drops those rules. The CSP no longer names the origin either,
 * so if this ever stops working the browser refuses the request instead of
 * quietly making it.
