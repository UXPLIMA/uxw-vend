/**
 * An endpoint that reads a whole table says how much of it it will read.
 *
 * `findMany` with neither a `where` to narrow it nor a `take` to cap it
 * returns the table. That is fine for a table whose size is decided when the
 * product is installed - there are as many roles as an operator made and as
 * many module rows as there are modules - and it is a slow leak for a table
 * that fills up while the site is used. Every API key anyone ever created,
 * every coupon the shop ever ran: the query gets heavier every week and
 * nothing says so until an admin screen stops answering.
 *
 * So the rule is not "always paginate". It is: a table that grows with use
 * has a ceiling, and a table that does not is written down here as such. The
 * list below is the whole argument, and adding to it should feel like a
 * decision.
 *
 * There used to be a second list, for the one route that read a whole table
 * on purpose: the CSV export. It does not any more. It reads a page, writes
 * it, and reads the next, which took its peak heap on 100k users from 228.9 MB
 * to 18.1 MB. With the exception gone the mechanism went too - a future export
 * that wants one should have to fail this test and argue for it.
