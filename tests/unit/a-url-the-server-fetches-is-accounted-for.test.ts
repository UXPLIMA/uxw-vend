/**
 * Every URL core fetches server-side is one somebody decided about.
 *
 * A `fetch` whose target is a literal is its own argument. A `fetch` whose
 * target is a variable is a question: where did that string come from, and can
 * anyone but the operator change it? `sendHealthWebhook` is the case that
 * proves the question is worth asking - it fetches a URL an admin types into
 * the alerting screen, and while the URL itself was checked against a private
 * host list, fetch was still free to follow a redirect to one. The check saw
 * hop one; the request went to hop two.
 *
 * So each of these is listed with where its URL comes from. Adding a fetch to
 * core means adding a line here, which means answering the question.
