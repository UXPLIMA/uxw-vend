/**
 * There is one command that runs what CI's check job runs.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md lists seven gates. CI's check job runs eleven, and the difference
 * is not academic: `check-marketplace-sync` and `npm audit` appear in neither
 * the documented list nor anybody's habit, and `test:coverage` enforces
 * per-file thresholds that plain `npm test` does not. Commits have gone red on
 * exactly that gap - five consecutive ones on the Docker job, and three in one
 * week on jobs a local run never touched.
 *
 * So the list lives in one place a person can run, and this test holds it
 * against the workflow. If CI gains a gate and `verify` does not, or the other
 * way round, the suite says so instead of a push finding out.
 *
 * Two CI jobs are deliberately outside it and named below: they need a
 * container and a browser, and a per-round local run of either is not the
 * trade this is making.
