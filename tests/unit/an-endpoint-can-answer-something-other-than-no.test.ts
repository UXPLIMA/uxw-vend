/**
 * An endpoint that only ever says no is a control that only ever fails.
 *
 * `csv-import-export` offers "Import Products (CSV)" in the admin screen. The
 * button posts to `/api/v1/admin/import?type=products`, and that route's
 * switch has one branch: `default`, answering 400 "No import types available.
 * Module-specific imports should use module APIs." The message is right, and
 * that is the point. Imports moved to the modules that own the data and this
 * generic endpoint stayed behind, with a file picker still pointed at it. An
 * operator picks a CSV and is told the import did not finish, every time,
 * with no import having started.
 *
 * Measured across 241 route files, it is the only one whose every answer is
 * an error status.
 *
 * The rule holds for handlers, not for guards: a route may answer 401, 403 or
 * 400 on most paths, as long as one path leads somewhere.
