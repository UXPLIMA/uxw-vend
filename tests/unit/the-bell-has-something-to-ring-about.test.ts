/**
 * A module that shows a feed has something that fills it.
 *
 * in-app-notifications shipped a bell, a notifications page, a Notification
 * table, a GET that reads it and a PATCH that marks rows read - and nothing,
 * anywhere, that ever wrote a row. Its `createNotification` helper was
 * exported and called by nobody, it declared no hook listeners, and its API
 * had no POST. Modules do not import each other, so a hook listener is the
 * only way an event elsewhere could have reached it. Installed, the bell was
 * empty by construction, for good.
 *
 * What makes that possible to ship is that every piece looks finished on its
 * own. So this checks the join: a module whose schema declares a table it
 * reads for a person has to have some path that creates a row in it.
 *
 * The listeners are held to addressing someone in particular. A hook payload
 * that carries no user id cannot produce a personal notification, and a
 * listener that invents a recipient - the site owner, the first admin - is
 * how a bell fills with things that are not the reader's business.
