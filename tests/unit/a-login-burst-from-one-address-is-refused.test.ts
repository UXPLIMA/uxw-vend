/**
 * What stops one address trying one password against every account.
 *
 * The lockout this product ships counts against the *account*: five wrong
 * passwords for one user and that user is locked. That is the right defence
 * against someone guessing one person's password and no defence at all against
 * the opposite shape, which is the common one. An attacker with a list of
 * addresses and a list of the passwords people actually use tries each
 * password once per account, never reaches any account's threshold, and walks
 * through the front door of whichever account used it.
 *
 * Measured against a production build before this existed: forty sign-in
 * attempts from one address against forty different accounts, and all forty
 * were served. Nothing counted them and nothing refused.
 *
 * Only failures count. A shared address is normal - an office, a school, a
 * mobile carrier's NAT, a household - and a ceiling that counts successful
 * sign-ins would lock those users out of a site that is working perfectly.
 * What is being bounded is guessing, and a guess that was right is not one.
 *
 * The address itself is only as trustworthy as the deployment: with no
 * TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS set, the caller writes their own forwarded header and can
 * buy a fresh budget by changing it. That is already true of every limit here
 * and is warned about at boot. It raises the cost of the naive attack, which
 * is the one that actually arrives.
