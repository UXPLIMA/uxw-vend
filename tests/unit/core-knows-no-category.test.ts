/**
 * The panel paints a category it has never heard of.
 *
 * The manifest schema says it plainly: `category` is free text "so core owns
 * no category vocabulary - the catalog groups by whatever values are
 * present". The panel then kept a map of five it did know - commerce,
 * community, management, gaming, content - and fell through to grey for
 * anything else. Forty modules declare `integration`, so the largest group in
 * the catalogue was the one the panel had no colour for, and a module that
 * invents a category of its own could never have one.
 *
 * It also put core in the position of naming `gaming`, which is a sector this
 * product does not take a position on: it runs a community, a shop, a
 * catalogue, and a game server is one of the things a module can add.
 *
 * A tone is derived from the name instead. Any category gets a stable one,
 * the five that existed keep getting a colour, and none of them is written
 * down here.
