/**
 * A date column that decides when something ends has to meet a clock.
 *
 * The punishments module stored `expiresAt` on every ban. The create form
 * offered the field, the API validated it, the update endpoint let an admin
 * move it, and the table printed the duration beside it. Nothing anywhere
 * compared it to the current time. `active` was the only thing the badge, the
 * filter and the JSON answer ever looked at, and the only thing that ever
 * wrote `active` was an admin pressing Revoke - so a seven-day ban was still
 * "Active" a year later, both on the public history page and to the game
 * server polling this module to decide who may log in.
 *
 * The failure is silent by construction: an expiry that is never read looks
 * exactly like an expiry that has not arrived. So the gate is structural. If a
 * module's schema declares a field whose name says it governs a window in
 * time, some file in that module has to put it next to a comparison - a Prisma
 * `lt`/`lte`/`gt`/`gte` filter, or a `getTime()`/`<`/`>` against now.
 *
 * Scoped to module schemas. Core's own expiring rows (sessions, tokens, rate
 * limit windows) are swept by code that does not name the column beside a
 * comparison operator, and inventing exemptions for them would blunt the rule
 * where it earns its keep.
