/**
 * A balance and the row that explains it are written together, or not at all.
 *
 * Every credit on this platform is a column on the user (`creditBalance`) and
 * a row in a ledger (`CreditTransaction`), and the ledger is the only place
 * anyone can look to find out where a balance came from. Three places moved
 * one and then the other in a second call: an admin grant, and both halves of
 * a wheel spin - the debit for a paid spin and the payout of a credits prize.
 *
 * A failure between the two calls is not a rare shape. The write that follows
 * a successful one is exactly where a connection drops, a pool times out or a
 * request is cancelled, and the result is silent: credits that left an account
 * with nothing recording it, or a balance that grew with no entry to explain
 * it. Nobody notices until somebody asks why the numbers do not add up, and by
 * then the evidence of what happened is the thing that was lost.
 *
 * So the rule is structural rather than case-by-case: a change to
 * `creditBalance` happens inside a transaction, and that same transaction
 * writes the ledger row.
 *
 * There is one place left that moves a balance. The wallet belongs to the
 * credits module, and the four modules that used to move it - checkout, a
 * paid spin, a marketplace sale, a member transfer - ask it through
 * `credit.change` and hand over the transaction they already have open. So
 * the rule is now checked where it is implemented, and the second half of it,
 * that the caller's transaction is the one used, is what keeps the guarantee
 * these tests were written for: a failure anywhere in a spin still undoes the
 * payment for it.
