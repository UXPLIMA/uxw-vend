/**
 * Waiting is said, not drawn.
 *
 * The panel had three loading vocabularies at once. A progress bar ran at the
 * top of the window on every navigation. Thirty-four `loading.tsx` files drew
 * a pulsing grey page under it, twenty-four of them the same generic list
 * shape with its default eight rows and five columns, none tuned to the
 * screen it stood for. Then the screen itself mounted and drew a third thing,
 * a spinner, because forty-four of the forty-eight admin pages fetch their
 * own data after mount.
 *
 * The drawings were wrong as well as surplus. The users list is twenty rows;
 * its placeholder was eight, so the page grew by twelve rows when the answer
 * came. The shop's placeholder card was `h-44` with `rounded-lg` against a
 * real card that is `aspect-[2/1]` with `rounded-xl`: at the width they are
 * drawn, 176px against 200px, and a different corner. A placeholder is a
 * second copy of a layout that nothing keeps in step with the first, and it
 * was already out of step.
 *
 * So the product does what a server rendered product does. The bar says a
 * navigation is running. A control that was clicked spins. A region still
 * waiting for its own request says so with `Waiting`, which shows nothing at
 * all for the first 300ms, because a placeholder that appears and vanishes
 * inside a third of a second reads as a glitch rather than as progress.
 *
 * `Skeleton` itself stays in `@/core/sdk/ui`. Removing a name from the
 * surface modules are written against is a major CORE_API_VERSION bump rather
 * than a tidy up, and a module author may still want one. This is about what
 * this product draws.
