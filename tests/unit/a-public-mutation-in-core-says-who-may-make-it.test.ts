/**
 * Core's own endpoints are held to the rule its modules are held to.
 *
 * A module's provider callbacks already have two gates: `validate-module`
 * rejects one that neither verifies a signature nor carries a
 * `@provider-callback: <why>`, and `provider-callback-csrf.test.ts` says the
 * same thing from the suite. Both read `module-sources` and stop there.
 *
 * Core answers on the same origin with the same authority and nothing checked
 * it. Measured across 241 route files: core has two endpoints that mutate
 * without a session, and both are sound - the webhook dispatcher verifies an
 * HMAC in constant time inside a replay window, and setup refuses as soon as
 * one user row exists. Neither fact is written anywhere a gate can read, so a
 * third such endpoint would land green.
 *
 * A route passes by doing one of four things: limiting its caller,
 * authenticating them, proving the request came from who it claims, or saying
 * in a `@public-mutation:` line why it needs none of those. The tag is the
 * same shape as `@provider-callback:` and carries the same obligation: a
 * reason, not a marker.
