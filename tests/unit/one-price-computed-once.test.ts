/**
 * What a shopper is shown is what a shopper is charged.
 *
 * The store had two implementations of the same arithmetic. `lib/pricing.ts`
 * is the one the checkout charges by, and it caps a fixed-value coupon at the
 * subtotal: fifty off a ten-pound cart is ten, because a discount larger than
 * the order would have the shop paying the customer. The coupon preview had
 * its own copy of the rules and had never been given that cap, so the cart
 * promised fifty off and the till took ten. A preview that disagrees with the
 * till is worse than no preview.
 *
 * There were two order-creating routes as well. `POST /store/orders`, which
 * nothing called and the manifest described as the way an admin enters a
 * manual order, had no admin check, priced the order itself without the
 * rounding to whole cents, claimed a use of a capped coupon outside any
 * transaction and before the order it belonged to existed, and then created
 * the order and emptied the cart with no payment step at all. It is gone; the
 * checkout is the checkout.
