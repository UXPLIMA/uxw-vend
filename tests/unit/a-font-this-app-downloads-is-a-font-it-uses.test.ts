/**
 * A font the app downloads is a font it renders with.
 *
 * `next/font/google` self-hosts Inter, Outfit and JetBrains Mono, preloads
 * them and generates a fallback whose metrics are adjusted to match, which is
 * how a font swap stops moving the page. It publishes each one under a
 * generated family name and hands you a CSS variable to reach it by.
 *
 * Nothing referenced those variables. Every theme asked for `Inter` and
 * `Outfit` by their plain names, which the self hosted copies are not
 * registered under, so all three downloads were dead weight on a first visit.
 * `Inter` still rendered, from `https://rsms.me`, because `@measured/puck`'s
 * stylesheet imports it and that stylesheet reaches public pages. It arrived
 * around 150ms and it is about ten percent wider than the system fallback,
 * which was enough to push the navigation onto a second row on nine public
 * pages: 0.05 to 0.12 of layout shift each, against a 0.1 budget.
 *
 * Two things have to hold for a variable to work here, and both are pinned.
 * The variables have to be declared on the element the theme tokens are
 * declared on, which is `html`: a custom property is substituted on the
 * element that declares it, so a token on `html` cannot read a variable that
 * only exists on `body`. And a theme has to actually name one.
