 * A create or edit form used to unfold as a card above the list it belongs to.

 * On a screen with two hundred roles that pushes the row you came to edit off
 * the bottom of the page. The browser's back button does not close it. A form
 * you are halfway through cannot be reloaded, linked, or reopened where you
 * left it, because nothing about it is in the URL. And the same screen is now
 * two screens wearing one address, so "where am I" has no answer.
 *
 * A create screen is a place, so it has an address: `/admin/roles/new`,
 * `/admin/roles/<id>/edit`, and - for the generic CRUD screen that thirteen
 * modules render, whose field definitions live in each module's own page file
 * - `?form=new` and `?form=<id>` on the screen's own path.
 *
 * A modal counts as the old shape too. It is still the same screen wearing
 * one address: nothing about it is in the URL, so it cannot be linked,
 * reloaded, or closed with the back button either.
 *
 * The gate bans a list screen holding a piece of state that decides whether a
 * form appears on top of it - in core and in every module's admin screens.
