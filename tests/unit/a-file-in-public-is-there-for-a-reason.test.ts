/**
 * Everything shipped in `public/` is either used or explained.
 *
 * `public/` is served verbatim and never tree shaken, so a file nobody links
 * is dead weight that no build step can notice. Six of them were:
 * `background1.png` through `background6.png`, 8.4 MB of the repository's 8.3
 * MB `public/` directory, with no reference in any source file, no default in
 * the seed and no `Setting` row pointing at them. They were deleted with this
 * test.
 *
 * A reference here is deliberately loose - the file's name appearing anywhere
 * in the tree, including inside another public file, because that is how
 * `manifest.json` reaches the two icons. Loose is the right side to err on:
 * this gate exists to catch a megabyte nobody meant to keep, not to police
 * how an asset is addressed.
