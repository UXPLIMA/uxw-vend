/**
 * A module that is not about one game does not assume one.
 *
 * The platform is general purpose: it runs a community, a shop and a
 * catalogue, and one of the things it can run is a game server. So a module
 * called "Leaderboard" may not decide that every member is a Minecraft
 * player - and it did. The ranking drew each row's avatar from
 * `mc-heads.net/avatar/<username>`, which means every member's name on the
 * page was sent to a third party on every render, and a site that has never
 * seen a game got Steve's head beside its top customers.
 *
 * "Player Profiles" reached the same service, and the shop's own admin help
 * offered "Minecraft username" as the example of a field to ask a buyer for.
 *
 * Three modules may say the word, and they are the ones it belongs to:
 * `minecraft-link` is about proving you own an account, `minecraft-litebans`
 * takes one plugin's bans and hands them to the punishments module, and
 * `servers` lists Minecraft among nine game types it can talk to over RCON.
 * Naming it there is the feature, and each of them says so in its own name.
 * Anywhere else it is an assumption about what this site is.
