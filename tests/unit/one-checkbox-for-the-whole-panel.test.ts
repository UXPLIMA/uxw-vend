/**
 * There is one checkbox, and this is how it stays one.
 *
 * Twenty-nine screens had written `<input type="checkbox">` by hand, between
 * them using ten different class strings - `rounded`, `w-4 h-4`, `w-3 h-3`,
 * `mt-1`, `accent-primary`, and five that said nothing at all. The result was
 * boxes of different sizes on adjacent screens, all of them painted by the
 * operating system rather than the theme: the system's blue on light, and a
 * white box with a black hairline on a dark panel, whatever colours the site
 * had chosen.
 *
 * `Checkbox` and `CheckboxField` in `@/core/sdk/ui` are the answer. This test
 * is the part that keeps the thirtieth from being written by hand.
