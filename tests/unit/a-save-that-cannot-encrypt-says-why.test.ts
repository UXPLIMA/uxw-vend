/**
 * What an operator is told when the install has nowhere safe to put a key.
 *
 * Gateway credentials are encrypted at rest now, which makes
 * `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` load-bearing for every payment module rather than
 * for the one that used to need it. An install that upgrades without setting
 * it cannot store a credential at all.
 *
 * Measured against a production build before this existed: pasting a Stripe
 * key answered 500 with an empty body, under a form that said "could not
 * save". Nothing on the screen, in the response or in the operator's reach
 * mentioned an environment variable, so the only way to the answer was the
 * server log - and the fix is one line of configuration.
 *
 * So the refusal carries a code the screen can turn into a sentence. The
 * message does not repeat the variable's value or a stack trace; it names what
 * failed and what to do, which is what an operator can act on.
