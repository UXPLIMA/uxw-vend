/**
 * A command that has finished ends.
 *
 * `--list` loads every installed module's seed to print what can be seeded,
 * and one of those seeds reaches a helper that imports the app's Prisma
 * client, which opens a connection pool at import time. The list printed and
 * the process stayed up: a seeding run from the day before was still running
 * twenty-two hours later, holding a database connection on a shared box.
 *
 * `--list` is the cheapest path that still imports every seed, which is where
 * the handle comes from, so it is the one this runs.
