 * Code nothing can reach.

 * Six files sat under `src/core` that no import anywhere resolved to. Two of
 * them were duplicates of something core already had, one was superseded by a
 * rewrite that left the original behind, and one was a back-compatibility shim
 * for an API no caller ever used. The other two were worse than dead: their
 * own doc comments described them as pieces a module or theme could render,
 * and the SDK boundary - modules import core only through `@/core/sdk*` - made
 * that impossible, so the store went and hand-rolled its own breadcrumb
 * instead. That copy was the one whose crumbs a keyboard could not reach.
 *
 * A file under `src/core` is either reachable or it is a lie about what the
 * platform offers.
