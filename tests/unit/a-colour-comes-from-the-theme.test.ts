/**
 * A colour is the theme's to choose.
 *
 * The sign-in page painted its own: a `bg-blue-600` submit button over a
 * `bg-blue-50` two-factor box, `text-red-600` on a `bg-red-50` error, and a
 * back link that turned blue on hover. None of it moved when an operator
 * changed the theme, and none of it moved in dark mode either, because dark
 * here is `[data-mode="dark"]` on the root rather than Tailwind's `dark:`
 * variant. A palette colour is a fixed hex whatever else the site is doing.
 *
 * It mattered most where it was: sign in, register, the two password
 * screens and the verification page are the first thing a visitor sees of an
 * install, and a themed site showed them Tailwind's blue.
 *
 * The theme's own tokens are `primary`, `destructive`, `success`, `warning`,
 * `muted`, `border`, `card`, `foreground` and their `-foreground` pairs, each
 * redefined by every theme and by dark mode. An opacity suffix is how you get
 * a tint: `bg-primary/10` is the light blue box, `border-destructive/25` the
 * hairline round a warning.
 *
 * The existing colour gate does not catch these. It resolves a class against
 * the `--color-*` tokens the theme declares and fails on a name that is not
 * one - and `blue-500` is a perfectly real Tailwind colour. It is just not
 * ours.
