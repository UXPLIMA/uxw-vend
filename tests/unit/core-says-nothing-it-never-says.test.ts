/**
 * Core's catalogue is the strings core actually says.
 *
 * `a-module-ships-no-string-it-never-says.test.ts` does this for the modules
 * and left core alone, on the grounds that a dead string costs less here: it
 * is not written into anybody's database at install time. It still costs
 * something. A key that no screen reads is a key a translator translates, a
 * reviewer reads, and the next person copies.
 *
 * Six had gone quiet, and five of them the same way: the key was renamed and
 * the old name stayed. `metrics_total` while the screen reads
 * `metrics_totalRequests`, `sidebar_theme` while the nav declares
 * `sidebar_themeLibrary`, and three more. A substring search hides exactly
 * this, which is why the match below is on a whole word.
 *
 * A key counts as said if its last segment appears as a word anywhere in the
 * tree, or if some template literal can build it: the breadcrumb reads
 * `crumb_${slug}` and the settings screens read `adm_${field}`, and neither
 * name appears in full anywhere.
