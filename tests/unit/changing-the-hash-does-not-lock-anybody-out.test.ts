// @vitest-environment node
/**
 * Which algorithm hashes a password, and what happens to the ones already
 * hashed with the other.
 *
 * An operator may now choose. The list is short on purpose: bcrypt, which
 * every account on every existing install is already hashed with, and scrypt,
 * which is memory-hard and comes with Node rather than with a dependency.
 * Nothing weaker is offered - not because an operator would pick it, but
 * because a dropdown is an endorsement, and a setting that can silently make
 * every password on the site easier to crack is worse than no setting.
 *
 * The whole risk of the feature is in one sentence: **changing the setting
 * must not lock anybody out.** Every account holds a hash made by whichever
 * algorithm was configured the day its password was last set, and the setting
 * is not a migration. So a hash says what made it, verification reads that
 * rather than the setting, and the setting decides only what the next hash is
 * made with.
 *
 * The upgrade path is the login itself. A password is only in the process at
 * one moment - when somebody types it - so that is the only moment an old hash
 * can be replaced with a new one. `needsRehash` marks the ones to rewrite, and
 * it says no when the stored hash already matches, because rewriting a hash on
 * every login is a database write on every login.
 *
 * A refused algorithm falls back to bcrypt rather than throwing. A typo in a
 * settings row is not a reason for nobody to be able to register.
