/**
 * The admin panel is painted in the theme's colours, not Tailwind's.
 *
 * `bg-green-100 text-green-700` is a light chip with dark green text on it,
 * always, whoever is looking and whatever theme is installed. The panel
 * switches to dark on `[data-mode="dark"]` at the root - not on Tailwind's
 * `dark:` variant, which follows the operating system - so those chips stayed
 * bright on a dark panel, and the `dark:bg-green-950` some of them carried
 * never fired at all. A theme that recoloured the whole admin could not touch
 * any of them either.
 *
 * Every one of them is a token now: `bg-success/10 text-success`, and the
 * tokens are redefined per mode and per theme. This keeps the palette out.
 *
 * Scope is core's own surface, which is both halves of the site: the admin
 * panel and the public chrome core draws around a theme - the navbar, the
 * footer, the profile screen, the homepage shell. All of it recolours with
 * the theme, and all of it had the same drift: a blue avatar circle, a red
 * error box, a sign-out in `text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50`, a breadcrumb
 * hovering blue on a site with no blue in it.
 *
 * A module is in scope too, on both of its surfaces. Its admin screens were
 * always here; its public ones were left out on the reasoning that a module's
 * own page is its own design. That was wrong, and the store showed why: the
 * VIP page painted its buy buttons `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white`
 * over the themed Button underneath, the support list gave every ticket
 * status a `bg-blue-100 text-blue-700` chip that stayed light on a dark site,
 * and prices and links were blue on a site with no blue in it. A site owner
 * installs a theme to recolour the site, and the store is the page most of
 * their visitors see.
 *
 * A theme under src/themes IS a design and names whatever colours it likes.
 * Brand marks are the one exception inside core: a Facebook button hovering
 * Facebook blue is not drift, it is the mark, so the footer's social links
 * name their own colours below.
