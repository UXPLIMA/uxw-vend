/**
 * The navigation bar folds what it cannot fit, instead of wrapping.
 *
 * The bar draws one link per enabled module, and modules are the point of the
 * product: an install with fifteen of them had fifteen links plus Home, which
 * at 1440px wrapped onto a second row and pushed the header's height around.
 * Nothing was hidden and nothing was reachable either - it just looked
 * broken, and it got worse with every module installed.
 *
 * So the bar keeps the first few and folds the rest into one dropdown. The
 * fold is by count rather than by measurement: a number is the same on the
 * server as in the browser, and anything measured is known only after paint,
 * which is a layout shift in the header on every single page.
 *
 * A bar an admin arranged in the navbar editor is drawn as arranged. They put
 * the dropdowns where they wanted them.
