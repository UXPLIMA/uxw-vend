/**
 * No amount the store computes may be a fraction of a cent.
 *
 * A percentage produces one at the first opportunity: 33% off 9.99 is 6.6933.
 * Nothing downstream used to round it, so an order was stored at 6.6933 while
 * the receipt said 6.69, and each gateway rounded on its own terms - Stripe
 * per line item, iyzico and PayPal with toFixed(2), PayTR on the total. One
 * checkout of three at 9.99 with a 33% bulk tier, a 15% coupon, a 5% creator
 * code and 8% tax recorded 17.51451925 and told Stripe to charge 17.50.
 *
 * The fix was to round inside the pricing math itself, so every consumer
 * receives whole cents and its own rounding is a no-op. This gate holds that:
 * it sweeps the awkward prices and percentages rather than re-testing the one
 * combination that exposed it, because the next fractional amount will come
 * from a combination nobody wrote down.
