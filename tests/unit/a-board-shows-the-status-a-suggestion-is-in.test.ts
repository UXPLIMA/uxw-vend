/**
 * Four lists of suggestion statuses, none of which agreed.
 *
 * The admin dropdown offered six. The schema that validates the request
 * accepted four of them, so choosing "Under Review" or "In Progress" answered
 * 400 and the screen said the operation had failed. The public board filtered
 * on `under_review`, `accepted` and `rejected` - spellings no suggestion could
 * ever hold - so three of its six filter buttons always returned an empty
 * board. And the board's badge fell back to the first word in its own map,
 * which meant a planned or a declined suggestion was labelled "Open" to every
 * visitor who read it.
 *
 * The six are the vocabulary now: the manifest already carried a name for each
 * of them in both languages, and the admin was already being offered all six.
