/**
 * The screens a person only ever sees on a bad day were the ones still in
 * English.
 *
 * An error boundary is a class component, and a class component cannot call a
 * hook, so its notice had been written as a literal and left there - which put
 * "Something went wrong" and "Reload Page" in front of a Turkish reader, and
 * "Failed to load ${moduleId}" in front of anyone whose homepage widget threw.
 * The reason given was that there is no provider to ask, and that was not so:
 * every one of these boundaries renders inside the locale layout's
 * `NextIntlClientProvider`. What a class cannot do, a function component
 * rendered by that class can.
 *
 * The genuinely untranslatable screens are the ones outside `[locale]`:
 * `app/global-error.tsx` replaces the root layout, and `app/error.tsx` and
 * `app/not-found.tsx` render above the provider. Those stay in English, and
 * this gate says so rather than leaving it to be rediscovered.
