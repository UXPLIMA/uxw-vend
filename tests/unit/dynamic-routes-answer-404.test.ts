/**
 * A URL that names nothing has to say so in the status line.
 *
 * Seven public module pages looked their subject up in the browser, so by the
 * time they knew there was no such player, product, article, form, page or
 * topic they had already sent 200 and a rendered shell. That is a soft 404:
 * a crawler indexes it, a link checker walks past it, and a monitor watching
 * for a status sees a healthy page. `/player/nobody` and
 * `/store/product/99999` both answered 200 on the demo.
 *
 * Rewriting seven interactive pages as server components would have been a
 * large change for a small question, so the module answers the question
 * separately: a route may declare a `resolver`, a file default-exporting
 * `(params) => Promise<boolean>`, and core's catch-all asks it before
 * rendering and calls `notFound()` on false.
 *
 * This gate used to accept a second answer: a page that is a server component
 * and calls `notFound()` itself. Blog was the only route relying on it, and
 * measured against a production build it answered 200 anyway. A module page
 * is rendered by the catch-all through the page registry, and by the time the
 * component runs the status line is already gone. `/blog/999999/anything`
 * returned 200 with a not-found body; `/help/no-such-article` and
 * `/store/product/999999/x`, which both use a resolver, returned 404. So the
 * resolver is the only answer this accepts now.
 *
 * This gate holds the rule for every module, installed or not, and pins the
 * two halves of the wiring that make it work.
