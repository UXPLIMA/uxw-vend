/**
 * The navbar the server sends is the navbar the browser settles on.
 *
 * The dark mode button is drawn before anyone knows which mode is active:
 * the mode lives in the DOM, put there by an inline script, and a hook reads
 * it after mount. The button held its place through that wait but was also
 * marked `disabled={!mounted}`, which makes one attribute of the served HTML
 * differ from the attribute the same component wants once it has mounted.
 *
 * React reported it as a hydration mismatch on the home page:
 *
 *     + disabled={true}   (client)
 *     - disabled={null}   (server)
 *
 * "This won't be patched up" is the part that matters - React gives up on
 * reconciling that subtree's attributes rather than fixing them. And the
 * attribute was buying nothing: before hydration the button has no click
 * handler attached, so a click already did nothing, and `disabled` only made
 * it unfocusable for the few hundred milliseconds in between.
 *
 * The test renders the button to a string and again after mount, and compares
 * the attributes of the two. The icon is deliberately not compared: it is a
 * child, both sides draw the same placeholder first, and it is the one thing
 * here that is allowed to arrive late.
