/**
 * A ban, a deletion, a demotion and a revoked device have to reach a session
 * that is already open.
 *
 * Under the JWT strategy nothing about a session is stored server-side: the
 * cookie carries the user id, the role and the priority, and Auth.js hands
 * them back on every request without asking the database anything. The `jwt`
 * callback is the only place that can look, and it looked under
 * `trigger === "update" || !token.role || token.rolePriority === undefined`.
 *
 * None of those is ever true again after a sign-in. The credentials provider
 * returns `role: user.role?.name || "member"` and `rolePriority ?? 0`, so
 * both are set and neither is falsy; `trigger` is "update" only when the
 * client calls `update()` itself, because @auth/core passes a trigger only
 * when isUpdate (see lib/actions/session.js). The config asked
 * `session.updateAge` to force an hourly refresh, but Auth.js reads updateAge
 * in the database-session branch only, so under `jwt` it is dead config.
 *
 * So the database was consulted exactly once, at sign-in, and everything
 * decided from the token stayed frozen for the life of the cookie: up to
 * thirty days for a session that ticked "keep me signed in", twenty-four
 * hours otherwise. Banning an account did not sign it out. Anonymising it
 * under the right to be forgotten did not sign it out. An admin demoted to
 * member stayed an admin. And `UserSession.isRevoked`, the column behind
 * "sign out this device" and "sign out everywhere" on the sessions screen,
 * was read in exactly one place: the block that no longer ran. Both buttons
 * wrote a row and changed nothing.
 *
 * The token now records when it was last checked, and is checked again once
 * that stamp is older than the interval: bounded staleness stated in one
 * place, instead of unbounded staleness nothing stated at all.
