/**
 * Every row in the notification preferences grid is a switch on something.
 *
 * The grid in /profile was decorative in four separate ways at once, and each
 * one was invisible from the others.
 *
 * The columns it renders are `["email", "inapp"]`, and a row shows a toggle
 * only where `channels.includes(column)`. All five modules declared `"site"`.
 * So the In-app column was a dash on every row, and announcements, which
 * declared only `"site"`, had a row with no toggles in it at all.
 *
 * Two of the five named an event nothing fires. forum declared
 * `forum.topic.replied` and emits `forum.post.created`; store declared
 * `store.order.status.changed` and emits `store.order.completed`. A person
 * could mute either one forever without changing anything.
 *
 * And `shouldNotify`, the check that reads a saved preference back, was
 * called by nobody. Its own doc comment described a caller - "the in-app or
 * email sender calls shouldNotify before actually delivering" - that did not
 * exist, and it was not on the SDK, so no module could have been that caller
 * even by trying.
 *
 * Four separate pieces, each plausible on its own, adding up to a settings
 * screen that wrote rows nothing would ever read.
 *
 * A fifth was left standing. Four modules declared an `email` channel and
 * nothing on the platform has ever sent a notification email; three of the
 * nine declared events - a blog article, a forum reply, a ticket reply - had
 * no listener at all, in any channel, so their whole rows were decorative.
 * The forum reply and the ticket reply are delivered in-app now, and the
 * emitters carry the recipient so a listener does not have to read another
 * module's tables to find them. The blog article is a message to everybody
 * rather than to a person; that is what core's broadcasts are, so the
 * declaration went rather than growing a fan-out nobody asked for.
 *
 * The rule that keeps all of it honest is the last one below: a channel a
 * module offers has to be a channel something delivers.
