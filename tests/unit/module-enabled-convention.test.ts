/**
 * The module enabled flag has one meaning and one helper.
 *
 * Two rules are gated here, both learned the hard way:
 *
 * 1. Nobody hand-rolls the comparison. Nineteen call sites once wrote
 *    `states[id] === true`, which reads an absent entry as disabled, while
 *    the proxy and `isModuleEnabled` read it as enabled. They agree while
 *    every module has a `ModuleConfig` row and diverge exactly when the
 *    database is unavailable, which is when the whole site's module chrome
 *    vanished while the proxy kept serving those same routes.
 *
 * 2. Every consumer of a generated registry honours the flag, unless it is
 *    listed below with the reason it must not.
