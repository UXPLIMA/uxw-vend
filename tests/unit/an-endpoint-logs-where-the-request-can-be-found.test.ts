/**
 * A failure inside a request is logged where that request can be found again.
 *
 * `log` is not a nicer `console`. It emits JSON lines in production and it
 * carries a correlation id, bound once in the proxy and propagated through
 * `AsyncLocalStorage`, so every line a request produces can be gathered back
 * into that request, however deep in a module hook it was written. It also
 * respects `LOG_LEVEL`.
 *
 * `console.error` has none of that. It writes one bare line with no id, no
 * level and no shape, and an operator reading the log of a failure has no way
 * to join it to the request that caused it. Forty two of those were spread
 * over twenty three endpoints.
 *
 * The rule is scoped to where a request exists. A client component has no
 * correlation id and cannot import the logger anyway, since it reaches
 * `next/headers` and `async_hooks`, so a `"use client"` file is left alone.

 * bundle. They keep the console, which is what a browser has anyway.
 *
 * `hooks.ts` is here for the same reason by a longer road: `@/core/sdk`
 * re-exports it, and that entry is isomorphic, so anything it pulls in is
 * compiled for the browser. `hooks-bootstrap.ts` exists precisely because the
 * two halves once shared a file and `next dev` answered 500 on every page
 * whose client graph touched the barrel.
 *
 * `logger.ts` is here for a different reason: it is what writes the line.
