/**
 * A module that is not about a game does not call a member a player.
 *
 * The platform runs a community, a shop and a catalogue, and a game server is
 * one of the things a module can add. So "Oyuncu adı girin" on a moderation
 * screen is the same mistake as fetching a Minecraft skin for a leaderboard:
 * the word decides what kind of site this is, on behalf of an operator who
 * may be running a bookshop.
 *
 * Two of these were made by tidying up. The profiles module was renamed to
 * Member Profiles and its own page went on saying Player Profile. The
 * punishments module was named for a game server while that was what it was,
 * and then the game part moved into a module of its own - `minecraft-litebans`
 * holds the plugin, the payload and the API key - leaving a record about
 * members with a form that asked for a player.
 *
 * Four modules may say it, because they are about a game: the one that proves
 * you own an in-game account, the one that takes a plugin's bans, the one
 * that talks to game servers, and the one that sends people to the listings a
 * server is ranked on. Everywhere else the word is an assumption.
 *
 * Only what a reader sees is checked, and only as prose. `playerName` is a
 * column in the shop and in the punishments table, and renaming a column is a
 * migration rather than a word. `{player}` is a substitution in a delivery
 * command an operator has already written and saved; renaming that breaks
 * every command on every install, and it is not a sentence about a person.
