/**
 * The site has one password policy: ten characters, an uppercase, a digit, and
 * not one of the two dozen passwords everybody tries first, plus whatever
 * higher minimum the operator set in Admin > Settings. `enforcePasswordPolicy`
 * is the only thing that applies all of it, and `security-settings.ts` says of
 * it that "every flow that accepts a new password goes through this".
 *
 * Two did not. `POST /api/setup`, which creates the first administrator, asked
 * zod for eight characters and nothing else, so the most privileged account on
 * a new install could be `12345678` while a visitor registering an ordinary
 * account was held to the full policy. `POST /api/v1/users`, where an admin
 * creates an account for somebody else, checked length against a separate pair
 * of constants that had drifted two characters below the policy's own.
 *
 * The rule this pins is the one that is actually checkable: a route that
 * writes a password onto a user row must have run the password through the
 * policy first. It is deliberately about the write rather than about
 * `bcrypt.hash`, because API keys and two-factor backup codes are hashed too
 * and answer to nothing here.
