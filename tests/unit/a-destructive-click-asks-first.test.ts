/**
 * Nothing is destroyed on one click without being asked about.
 *
 * The cart's "Clear Cart" button emptied it outright: an hour of picking
 * things out, gone to a misplaced pointer, with no undo and no basket left to
 * reconstruct it from. Unlinking a Discord or Minecraft account was the same
 * shape, and getting it back meant going through the provider again.
 *
 * The site already has one answer for this, `useConfirm`, and most screens
 * reach for it. This holds the rest to it: every DELETE a person can set off
 * has to pass through a confirmation somewhere in the function that sends it.
 *
 * A toggle is not a deletion. `/admin/permissions` sends DELETE to clear a
 * checkbox that the next click sets again, and asking twice for something
 * that undoes itself teaches people to click through the question - which is
 * what makes the dialog worthless where it matters.
