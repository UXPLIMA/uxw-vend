/**
 * A public list that grows offers a way through it.
 *
 * Measured across the modules on 2026-09-08: three of the fourteen public
 * lists had a pager. The rest drew whatever the endpoint happened to return
 * and stopped there - the store asked for twelve products and rendered them
 * with no way to reach the thirteenth, so a category with thirty quietly
 * ended at its first screenful, and every suggestion, download, trophy,
 * ticket and notification past the first load simply was not on the page.
 *
 * None of it looked broken, which is why it lasted: a list that stops has
 * exactly the shape of a list that ended.
 *
 * The rule is about growth, not length. A list bounded by something an
 * operator sets by hand - the four vote sites, the team - is named below with
 * what bounds it.
