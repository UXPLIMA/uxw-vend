/**
 * Two questions nothing was asking of a new endpoint.
 *
 * An admin route that forgets its permission check is not a bug anyone sees:
 * it works perfectly for the administrator who wrote it, and the person it
 * lets in is the one who never reports it. The same is true of a payment
 * callback that trusts what was posted to it, except there the reward is
 * money.
 *
 * Both were verified by hand and both were clean. That is exactly when the
 * check is worth writing down, because the next endpoint is the one nobody
 * reads twice.
 *
 * A provider callback cannot be authenticated the way a normal route is:
 * whoever posts it has no session. It has to prove the message another way,
 * either by verifying a signature the provider computed, or by throwing the
 * message away and asking the provider directly with this site's own
 * credentials. Four gateways here do the first and two do the second; both
 * are accepted, and doing neither is not.
