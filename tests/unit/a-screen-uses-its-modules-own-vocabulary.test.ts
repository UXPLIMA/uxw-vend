/**
 * A screen may not invent a value the module it belongs to has no word for.
 *
 * Twice now, one module has held two vocabularies for the same column. The
 * punishments admin form stored six types while its public page filtered on
 * four, one of them spelled differently, so the Warning filter matched nothing
 * an admin had ever created. The suggestions board filtered on `under_review`,
 * `accepted` and `rejected` while the schema accepted `underReview`, `planned`
 * and `declined`, so three of its filter buttons always came back empty and
 * its badge labelled a declined suggestion "Open".
 *
 * Both were invisible: a filter that matches nothing looks exactly like a
 * filter with nothing to match. So once a module declares its vocabulary, the
 * screens have to use it. Any list of string literals inside a module that
 * overlaps a declared vocabulary must be drawn from it.
