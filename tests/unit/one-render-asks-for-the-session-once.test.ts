/**
 * A page that asks who is signed in, three times, for one answer.
 *
 * `auth()` is a database round trip: the session row, the user's ban and
 * role, and the role itself. Nothing about a server render makes that
 * obvious, so a layout, the page inside it and a component inside that each
 * called it without knowing about the others. Rendering `/tr/admin` issued
 * thirty-one queries, nine of them the same three repeated three times.
 *
 * `getSession` is `auth()` wrapped in React's `cache`, which deduplicates for
 * the length of one render, which is exactly the window in which the answer
 * cannot change. The same page issues twenty-three queries now.
 *
 * `auth()` itself is deliberately untouched: it is also the entry point for
 * middleware and route handlers, where there is no render to scope a cache
 * to. That is why this gate is scoped to the trees that render.
