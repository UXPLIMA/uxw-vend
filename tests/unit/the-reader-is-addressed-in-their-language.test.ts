/**
 * A Turkish admin is told what happened in Turkish.
 *
 * The site ships two locales and every screen is translated, so the English
 * that survived hid in the places nobody rereads: what a failed write says,
 * what a field suggests before it is filled, and what a browser dialog asks.
 * A Turkish admin working through a Turkish panel met "Something went wrong",
 * "Failed to create product" and a native `prompt()` box with an English
 * question in it - not because those screens were untranslated, but because
 * those particular sentences were never keys.
 *
 * Two shapes produced most of them.
 *
 * `data.error || t("saveFailed")` reads as a translated fallback and is the
 * opposite: `error` is the server's own English sentence, so the fallback is
 * reached only when the endpoint says nothing. Twenty-one of these had an
 * English literal in the fallback slot as well, which is what made them
 * visible. `writeError` in the SDK exists for exactly this and explains why.
 *
 * `window.prompt()` cannot be translated, styled or dismissed by keyboard the
 * way the rest of the panel can. Two screens collected a ban reason and a
 * rejection reason through it. `usePrompt` from `@/core/sdk/ui` is the
 * in-page equivalent and is what they use now.
 *
 * The dates go with the language: `toLocaleDateString()` with no argument
 * reads the *server's* locale during SSR and the browser's afterwards, so the
 * same row rendered two different dates depending on who drew it.
 * `useLocalDate` takes the site locale and is the only place that call is
 * allowed to appear.
