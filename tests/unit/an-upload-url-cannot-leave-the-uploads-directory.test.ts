/**
 * The route that streams uploaded files off disk.
 *
 * Next bakes `public/` into a manifest at build time, so files written after
 * the build are not served by the static handler. This route takes the
 * `/uploads/*` namespace and reads them itself, which means it turns a URL
 * into a filesystem path, and that is the shape of every directory traversal
 * there has ever been.
 *
 * It defends twice: it refuses a segment that is a dot, a double dot or that
 * carries a separator, and it then requires the resolved path to sit inside
 * the uploads directory. Neither defence had a test, and a request from
 * outside cannot reach the route to prove them, because the locale middleware
 * answers a traversal attempt with a redirect before the route is asked. So
 * the handler is called directly here.
