/**
 * A link does not send a Turkish visitor to the English page.
 *
 * `localePrefix` is `always`, so every real path carries `/tr` or `/en`. A
 * navigation written without one is not a broken link - it resolves - which is
 * why these survived: the proxy rewrites the bare path to the default locale,
 * so `/auth/login` quietly becomes `/en/auth/login`. The visitor lands on the
 * page they asked for, in a language they may not read.
 *
 * The worst of them was the admin gate. `redirect("/auth/login")` in the admin
 * layout meant every signed-out visitor of `/tr/admin` arrived at the English
 * login form, and this was reproducible on the demo before the fix:
 *
 *     curl -sIL /tr/admin  ->  /en/auth/login
 *
 * `next/link` and `next/navigation` know nothing about locales. The wrappers
 * in `@/core/lib/i18n/navigation` - published to modules as
 * `@/core/sdk/navigation` - carry the active prefix, and the SDK file has said
 * so in a comment since it was written with nothing enforcing it.
 *
 * `usePathname` is deliberately not covered here. Both versions are correct
 * for different jobs: next-intl's strips the prefix, `next/navigation`'s keeps
 * it, and a callbackUrl built for a round trip back to this page needs the one
 * that keeps it.
