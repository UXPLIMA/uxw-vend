/**
 * An archive that becomes files on disk is checked by one set of rules.
 *
 * `validateZipEntries` is that set: it refuses a symlink, a null byte, an
 * absolute path, a `..` segment, a file type no module needs, an archive with
 * too many entries, an entry larger than 10 MB, a total over 200 MB, and a
 * compression ratio over a hundred to one, which is what a zip bomb looks
 * like from the outside.
 *
 * Seven places unpack an archive. Six called it. The setup wizard grew its
 * own smaller version instead: it refused a `..` and resolved each path back
 * under the target, which is the traversal half and the important half, but
 * it capped only the compressed size of the file it was handed. Its own
 * comment said it "uses the same validation rules as the full marketplace
 * installer", which had stopped being true.
 *
 * The archives it reads ship with the platform, so this was a divergence
 * rather than a hole. Divergences are how holes arrive: the day that path is
 * pointed at something downloaded, whoever moves it will read the comment.
