/**
 * A panel screen uses the panel it was given.
 *
 * The admin layout hands every screen the full width beside the sidebar. A
 * handful of screens then put a measure back on their own root: the Turnstile
 * and R2 settings opened `max-w-2xl`, the export screen `max-w-md`, and three
 * create forms capped the form inside a card that still stretched, so the
 * card drew a border around an empty right half. On a desktop panel the
 * result was a page that looked broken rather than composed, and the
 * operator's own report was the shortest description of it: half pages.
 *
 * The settled answer is on the rate limits screen. A screen that has more to
 * show than fits one column groups it into cards and lays them out in a grid,
 * rather than stacking one narrow column against the left edge.
 *
 * A measure is still right for some things, and each of those says so in the
 * same class list:
 *
 *   - `w-full` with it. That is a dialog or an error card: it fills whatever
 *     it is centred in, up to a limit. It is not a page shrinking itself.
 *   - `truncate` or an `overflow-` with it. That is a cell clipping a long
 *     value so a table keeps its shape.
 *   - a form control. A search box the width of the page is a worse search
 *     box.
