/**
 * The site's own address is resolved in one place.
 *
 * `app-url.ts` exists because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is frozen into the bundle by
 * `next build` and uxwVend ships a prebuilt image, so a canonical URL read
 * that way is whatever CI had, for every installation on earth. It also
 * rejects a value that is not an absolute http(s) URL.
 *
 * Three callers had written the lookup out by hand and got a different answer
 * each time. Two of them build the links in the verification and the
 * password-reset emails and fell back to `http://localhost:3000` - a port
 * nothing in this project listens on - and neither checked that the value it
 * read was a URL at all, so a host written without a scheme produced a link
 * no mail client can follow. The third built the share links under a blog
 * article and fell back to the empty string, handing Twitter and Facebook a
 * path with no host on any install that had not set AUTH_URL.
 *
 * The variables themselves stay readable in the few places that need the raw
 * value for something other than an address: session-cookie.ts decides the
 * cookie's `secure` flag and its name from the scheme, csrf.ts collects the
 * allowed origins, and app-url.ts is the resolver.
