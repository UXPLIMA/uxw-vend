/**
 * Twenty credentials used to sit in the settings table as plain text.
 *
 * The product shipped `secret-storage.ts` - AES-256-GCM, versioned, with a
 * migration path where a value written without the `v1:` prefix is read as
 * legacy plaintext so callers can encrypt on the next write - and exactly one
 * module used it. Every payment gateway read its key straight out of `Setting`
 * and used the string as it came. `/api/v1/settings` wrote what it was given
 * and had no notion of a setting being a secret at all, then handed the same
 * values back to the browser on every visit to a settings screen. So a Stripe
 * secret key, a PayPal client secret and eighteen more lived in a column any
 * database dump carries, and this product makes those dumps itself.
 *
 * This file used to be a ratchet. It pinned the twenty and refused a
 * twenty-first, because encrypting them meant marking which settings are
 * secrets, encrypting on write, decrypting in every module's reader and
 * migrating what was already stored - and that touches the payment path, where
 * this repository says to escalate rather than guess.
 *
 * The decision was made and the work is done, so the ratchet is now a
 * guarantee. Each of the twenty is declared by the module that owns it, which
 * is what makes core encrypt it without ever naming a module. Two of them do
 * not look like credentials from the key name alone: `cloudflare_r2_config`
 * and `cloudflare_turnstile_config` are JSON blobs with the secret one level
 * down, and the first version of this gate matched on the key name and walked
 * straight past both. A gate that only sees the shape it was written for is
 * the thing it was written against, so the declaration addresses the field.
