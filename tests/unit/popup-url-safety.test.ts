/**
 * The popups module shipped two renderers for the same popup. The one that
 * rendered through `layoutComponents` validated its URLs and carried a comment
 * saying why; the one that rendered through the `layout.overlay` slot passed
 * `popup.link` straight into an `href` and `popup.image` straight into a `src`.
 * Both were on screen at once, so the validation the first one did bought
 * nothing - the unguarded copy was right underneath it.
 *
 * One renderer survives, and this is the rule it enforces.
