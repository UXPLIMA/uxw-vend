/**
 * Every control that moves a reader between pages comes from one component.
 *
 * `Pagination` has existed since the admin lists got pagers, and twenty-eight
 * screens use it. Eleven did not: measured on 2026-09-11, the blog index drew
 * two bare text links with "2 / 7" between them, the homepage news section
 * drew chevrons with labels and every page number, the forum drew outline
 * buttons with no numbers at all, three admin lists drew icon-only chevrons,
 * and the punishments list drew the raw characters « and » with no
 * translation behind them.
 *
 * Six looks for one act. A reader who learns where "next" is on the blog
 * finds something else in the forum, and each hand-written pager carried its
 * own bug: the blog admin's hrefs were built as `?page=N`, which dropped
 * whatever filter the admin had typed.
 *
 * The rule is about the control, not the act of paging. A carousel, an image
 * gallery and a setup wizard all move between things; none of them is a pager,
 * and none of them mentions a page count.
