/**
 * A phone reaches everything the navigation offers.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-11 with 89 modules installed: the navbar offered eight
 * links and folded the rest into a "More" dropdown, and a phone got neither.
 * It got a bottom bar holding Home, the first three module links in registry
 * order, and Profile - five slots for a site with forty-four module screens.
 * Everything else was reachable only by scrolling to a footer that measured
 * 670px of a 1933px page, and the footer listed nine of them.
 *
 * Nothing about that looked broken. The bar was full, the pages existed, and
 * which three modules won the slots depended on the order a registry happened
 * to enumerate.
 *
 * So the bar is gone and a phone gets the whole list, in a panel. The rule
 * that matters is the one below: what the navigation offers is what a phone
 * can reach, with no arithmetic in between.
