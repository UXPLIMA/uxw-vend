/**
 * A form that sends nine values is one save, not nine.
 *
 * Four endpoints wrote a loop of `await prisma.<model>.upsert(...)`. The site
 * settings form sends nine keys and the general settings form sends more, so
 * a connection that dropped on the fifth left four of them written and
 * answered with a message that said the save had failed - and the operator,
 * being told nothing was saved, has no reason to go and look at what was.
 * The module screen's cascade-disable was worse: stopping halfway left some
 * dependents disabled and the module they depend on still enabled, which is
 * precisely the state that branch exists to prevent.
 *
 * Prisma takes an array of operations and runs them in one transaction, which
 * is also one round trip instead of N. This gate keeps the loops from coming
 * back.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: a write inside a loop over a *request body*,
 * which is what these were. A loop over rows the server itself produced - a
 * migration, a seed, a backfill that must survive partial progress - is a
 * different thing and lives in scripts/, which is not searched.
