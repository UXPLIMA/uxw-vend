/**
 * A column an `orderBy` names has to exist on the model it orders.
 *
 * Neither typecheck catches this. Measured on 2026-09-07 by renaming a real
 * column to `unitsSoldXX` in the store's product list: `tsc --noEmit` exited 0,
 * `typecheck:modules` reported zero errors, `npm run build` succeeded, and the
 * running server answered every request to that endpoint with a 500 and
 * "Unknown argument". Prisma's `orderBy` takes a union that includes an array
 * form, and an object literal inside a ternary lands in it without the excess
 * property check ever firing.
 *
 * The same hole hides a staler problem. `prisma/schema.prisma` is merged from
 * the modules that are *installed* under `src/modules`, so a column added to a
 * module's source and not yet installed is missing from the client the gates
 * compile against - and the gates stay green while the app is broken. This
 * test reads the merged schema, which is the same file the client is generated
 * from, so it fails in exactly that situation too and says which column.
