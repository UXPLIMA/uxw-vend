/**
 * An admin screen says what it is, and says it the same way everywhere.

 * `AdminPageHeader` draws the title, the description, the back link and the
 * row of actions, and the breadcrumb above it reads the same route. A screen
 * that rolls its own `<h1>` gets a different size, a different gap under it,
 * its buttons somewhere else, and a back link that may or may not exist -
 * which is what the panel used to look like, and what a hundred and forty
 * screens across core and seventy-eight modules would drift back into one
 * page at a time.
 *
 * Most module screens never name the header at all: they hand a title and a
 * subtitle to `AdminCrudPage`, `SettingsForm` or `AuthProviderSetup`, and
 * those draw it. That is the better arrangement - a module says what its
 * screen is called and core decides what a screen looks like - so it counts
 * here, and this test also holds those three to using the header themselves.
