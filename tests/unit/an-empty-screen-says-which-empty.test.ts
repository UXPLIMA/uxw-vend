/**
 * A screen with nothing on it says which kind of nothing it is.
 *
 * A list has two ways to be empty: nothing was created yet, or the request
 * behind it never came back. Forty screens rendered the same sentence for
 * both. They read their content, dropped every failure on the floor, and
 * showed "no orders yet", "no categories", "all essential modules are
 * installed" - with a green tick - for a server that was down, a session that
 * had expired or a connection that was not there.
 *
 * Two shapes did it. `.catch(() => setLoading(false))` turns a rejection into
 * a finished load with no rows, and `.then(r => r.ok ? r.json() : { items: []
 * })` substitutes an empty answer for a refusal without the rejection ever
 * happening. Both look deliberate in review, which is why there were so many.
 *
 * The two that cost the most: the observability page said "no errors" when it
 * had not heard back, and the widget settings screen showed every widget at
 * its default after a failed load, so saving wrote those defaults over what
 * the admin actually had.
 *
 * This checks every read that feeds a screen with an empty state. What may
 * stay silent is listed below with the reason, one entry per file.
