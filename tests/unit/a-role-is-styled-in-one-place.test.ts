/**
 * An operator styles a role once, and every screen showing it obeys.
 *
 * `role-css.ts` decides what an operator may write and `RoleName` decides how
 * it is drawn, and between them they got the hard part right twice. What
 * neither of them could do is reach the screens: five places drew a role by
 * hand out of `role.color`, so an operator who wrote a gradient saw it nowhere
 * and an operator who wrote nothing saw the same flat colour they always had.
 * The column had a writer and no readers, which is the mirror of the defect
 * this project already has a name for.
 *
 * So there are two components and this gate, which is the only thing that
 * keeps a sixth screen from being written the same way. A name goes through
 * `RoleName`, the pill beside it through `RoleBadge`, and neither of them is
 * something a screen can approximate with a style attribute - the whole point
 * of the feature is a rule, not an inline colour, because a gradient with
 * `background-clip` or an animation with a keyframe does not survive being
 * flattened into one.
