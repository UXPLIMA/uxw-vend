/**
 * Every handler that changes a row says who is allowed to change it.
 *
 * This is the write-side twin of the read-side gates. Those ask whether a
 * visitor may see a thing; this asks whether the caller may alter it, which is
 * the more expensive one to get wrong: a read leaks, a write is somebody
 * else's ticket edited, somebody else's article deleted.
 *
 * The check has to follow a helper to be worth anything. This codebase does
 * not write `await auth()` in a handler and compare ids by hand - it writes
 * `denyUnlessAdmin()`, `canAccessTicket(userId, id, "edit")`,
 * `denyGuestView()`. A scan that only looked inside the handler reported four
 * offenders on 2026-09-07 and every one of them was a helper it could not see
 * through. So this resolves one level: functions the file defines, and
 * functions it imports from a relative path.
 *
 * One thing is asked of each handler: that some guard runs before it writes.
 *
 * A second was written and thrown away, and the reason is worth keeping. The
 * idea was to also require that the guard *names the caller* - a route which
 * checks a session exists and then writes a row identified only by a URL
 * parameter has authenticated a stranger rather than authorised an owner. It
 * cannot be checked this way. `session.user.id` appears in these handlers for
 * reasons that are not authorisation, most often as a rate-limit key, so the
 * assertion was true of every handler whatever its guard did. Breaking a real
 * ownership check on purpose left it green.
 *
 * Both assertions were tried against a deliberately broken handler. The one
 * that survives names the file and the verb when every guard token is removed;
 * the one that did not is gone rather than left as a light that is always
 * green. Telling those apart needs to know whether the id reaches a decision
 * or a cache key, which is more than a regular expression has.
