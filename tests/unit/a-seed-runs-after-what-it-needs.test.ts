/**
 * The demo seeder's two rules, written down.
 *
 * A seed that runs before the data it hangs on writes rows with no parent, or
 * throws, and either way the site it was meant to fill is emptier than
 * before. The runner orders seeds by what each one says it needs; a circle
 * between them is a mistake nobody notices at three in the morning, so it is
 * an error rather than a hang or an arbitrary winner.
 *
 * The second rule is quieter: a module may name a need that this site has not
 * installed. That is not an error. The store seeds orders whether or not the
 * credits module is there, and a site chooses its own modules.
