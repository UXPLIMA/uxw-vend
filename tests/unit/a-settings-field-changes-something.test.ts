/**
 * A settings field is a promise: type a value, press Save, something behaves
 * differently. `SettingsForm` keeps that promise only as far as the `Setting`
 * row - it writes whatever key the screen names and reports success, whether
 * or not a single line of code ever reads the key back.
 *
 * Nine of the fifty-seven fields on the shipped screens named a key nothing
 * read. Two modules offered a Resend API key, a from-address and a sender
 * name, and the mailer took all three from the environment instead: an
 * operator pasted their key into the admin panel, saw "Saved", and mail
 * stayed off with the key now sitting in the database earning nothing.
 * login-protection offered a maximum-login-attempts field while the lockout
 * threshold came from ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT_ATTEMPTS, so an operator who set 3
 * still got 10. Four more offered to rewrite email subjects and a welcome
 * body that nothing composed from.
 *
 * The three that named a real capability are wired up now; the rest are gone
 * from their screens. This keeps the next one from shipping: a field's key
 * has to be named by code somewhere other than the form that writes it.
