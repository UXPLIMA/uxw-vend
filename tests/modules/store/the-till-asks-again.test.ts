/**
 * The checkout asks the same questions the button asked.
 *
 * A window, a per-person limit and a daily allowance are all enforced twice:
 * once where a shopper can see it, so they are told before they try, and once
 * at the till, because the first one runs in a browser and a browser is not
 * something a shop may rely on. `curl` skips the button.
 *
 * The prices work the same way. A scheduled sale changes what the shop shows;
 * a checkout that charged the column instead would take a different amount
 * from the one on the screen, which is the kind of difference a payment
 * provider settles and a customer disputes.
