/**
 * The sales column counts sales.
 *
 * It printed `product._count.orderItems`, and the endpoint behind the screen
 * selects the product's own columns and its category. It has never sent a
 * `_count`, so the column has read `undefined` and drawn the `|| 0` behind it
 * since it was written: every product in every install, however much it had
 * sold, said zero.
 *
 * `unitsSold` is the number to draw. It is incremented where a claim is paid
 * for and decremented where one is refunded, which is also what the public
 * "most popular" ordering reads, so the shop's two answers to "what sells"
 * now come from the same column.
