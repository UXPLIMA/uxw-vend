/**
 * Copying a product, and the three things a copy must not inherit.
 *
 * An operator builds one rank carefully - the commands it runs, the fields
 * the buyer fills in, the hours it is on sale, who may buy it - and then
 * needs four more of it at four prices. Typing it out again is where the
 * fourth one loses a delivery command nobody notices until somebody pays.
 *
 * What makes this worth a test is not what is copied. It is what is not:
 *
 * - the copy is switched off, because a product that appears in the shop the
 *   instant it is made is one nobody has renamed or priced yet, and the
 *   window between the click and the edit is a real sale at the wrong price;
 * - it has sold nothing, because a copy inheriting the original's sales count
 *   ranks above products that really outsold it on the day it is made;
 * - it carries no processor price id. That id names a price object belonging
 *   to the original. Two products pointing at one of them means a refund on
 *   either looks like a refund on both.
 *
 * Everything an operator built by hand does come across, including the rows
 * held in other tables - the delivery commands and the buyer's fields - since
 * a copy that delivers nothing is the failure this feature exists to prevent.
 *
 * The copy's name comes from the caller rather than from here. A name is a
 * row a visitor reads, and the only place that knows which language to say
 * "copy" in is the screen the operator is looking at.
