/**
 * A campaign: one price change, ten products, opening and closing by itself.
 *
 * Every rule a campaign needs already exists per product - a weekly window, a
 * sale price, an allowance that refills - and setting them ten times by hand
 * is how a shop ends up with nine products on offer and one that was missed.
 * The campaign is the missing noun: name it once, list what is in it, and it
 * turns itself on and off.
 *
 * Two decisions are pinned here because both are silent when wrong.
 *
 * The window wraps past midnight, exactly as a product's own hours do - a
 * Friday event running 22:00 to 02:00 is open at half past midnight on
 * Saturday, and a check that reads Saturday against a Friday list shuts the
 * shop in the middle of its own event.
 *
 * And where a product is already discounted, the buyer pays the lower of the
 * two. A campaign is meant to be an offer; charging somebody more than the
 * standing sale price because an event started is the opposite of one.
