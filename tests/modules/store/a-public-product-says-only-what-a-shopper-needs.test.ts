/**
 * A public product carries the fields a shopper needs, and no others.
 *
 * The public reads asked for the whole row: `include: { category }` and no
 * `select`, so every scalar Prisma knows about went out to anyone. Today that
 * is `deliveryData` - an operator-authored blob nothing in the product reads,
 * so whatever an operator puts there is published - plus `stripePriceId` and
 * two timestamps the page never draws.
 *
 * The size of it is not the point. The point is that the published shape was a
 * consequence of the schema rather than a decision, so the next column added to
 * `Product` would have been public the moment it was added, and the answer is
 * held by a shared cache, so it would have been published to a CDN too.
 *
 * The operator's screen needs the whole row, and asks its own endpoint for it,
 * the same way the operator's listing already does.
