/**
 * A suggestion carries a discussion, and the discussion has the same rules
 * the board has.
 *
 * The board counted votes and nothing else, so it answered "how many people
 * want this" and never "what do they want out of it" - which is the half an
 * operator needs before building anything. Comments are that half.
 *
 * Three things had to hold before they could be public:
 *
 * A reply is held behind the same switch as the suggestion it sits under. An
 * operator who reviews suggestions has not asked to let the replies through
 * unread, and a moderation queue that lists one and not the other is a queue
 * somebody will trust by mistake.
 *
 * A pending reply is visible to its author and to a moderator, and to nobody
 * else. Hiding it from its own author is how a person posts the same thing
 * three times.
 *
 * And the list has a ceiling. A discussion is readable by anyone and grows
 * with every reply, so reading all of it is a query with no limit - the shape
 * that made four other endpoints in this repository slow before anyone
 * noticed.
