/**
 * A visitor sees the wheel, not the odds behind it.
 *
 * `/api/v1/wheel/prizes` answers everybody: the page needs each segment's
 * name, colour and payout to draw the wheel and label it. It read the rows
 * with no `select`, so every column went out, and one of them is
 * `probability`, the number an operator tunes to decide how often a prize is
 * drawn. The public page has never read it: it appears once, in the interface
 * the file declares, and nowhere else.
 *
 * It is not a secret in the sense a token is, and this is not a breach. It is
 * a number an operator set in an admin screen and would not expect a visitor
 * to be able to read, and the wheel draws exactly the same without it.
 *
 * An administrator still gets everything, because the screen that edits the
 * odds is the reason they exist.
