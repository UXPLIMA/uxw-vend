/**
 * The public wheel listing answers one shape, whoever is reading.
 *
 * `/api/v1/wheel/wheels` used to answer two different things at one address:
 * a visitor got each wheel with its prizes, its cooldown and whether they may
 * turn it, and an administrator got the raw rows the admin screen edits -
 * every wheel including the switched-off ones, no prizes, no refusal. The
 * public page reads `wheel.prizes` to list what is on the wheel, so signing in
 * as an administrator and opening /wheel threw a TypeError before the page
 * rendered: the site was broken for exactly the person who has to look at it.
 *
 * The rule this pins is not "include prizes". It is that a public endpoint
 * answers the same question for everybody, and the screen that manages the
 * rows asks somewhere else. An administrator browsing the site is a visitor.
