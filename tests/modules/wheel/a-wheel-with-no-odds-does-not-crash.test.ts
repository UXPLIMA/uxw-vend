/**
 * Every prize set to zero took the wheel down.
 *
 * The draw is weighted: it sums each active prize's `probability` and picks a
 * point inside that sum with `randomInt(0, Math.ceil(total * 1000))`. Zero is
 * a probability the admin screen accepts and the schema stores, so an
 * operator who has switched a prize off by setting its odds to zero, and done
 * that to all of them, leaves a total of zero. `randomInt(0, 0)` does not
 * return zero: it throws ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE, so every spin answered 500.
 *
 * No money is lost, because the debit happens in the transaction after the
 * draw. What is lost is the answer: the route already tells a visitor when
 * there are no prizes and when they have spun today, and this case said
 * nothing an operator or a visitor could act on.
