/**
 * Handing an order to a service that pulls, rather than one we push to.
 *
 * This integrator does not take invoices. It asks for orders: it calls the
 * shop on a schedule with a date window, gets a list back, and issues the
 * documents itself. So what this module ships is answers, and the whole of
 * its correctness is whether those answers describe the sale.
 *
 * It wants every price twice, once with tax and once without, and that is
 * where a shop gets it wrong. A shop that quotes tax-inclusive prices - which
 * is the law for a consumer sale in most of the places this is used - has
 * already got the tax inside the number on the page. Multiplying it up again
 * puts a figure on a legal document that is higher than what the customer
 * paid. At twenty per cent the tax inside 120 is 20, not 24, and the six lira
 * of difference is exactly what a tax office checks.
 *
 * The store already knows which way it prices, and this reads that rather
 * than assuming: the same split the till used, or the invoice disagrees with
 * the card statement.
