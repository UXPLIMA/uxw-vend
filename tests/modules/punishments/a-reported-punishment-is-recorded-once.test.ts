/**
 * A punishment reported twice is one punishment.
 *
 * The module that watches a game server answers a webhook, and a webhook is
 * delivered more than once: a retry after a timeout, a re-sync after the
 * server was down. LiteBans sends the same row id each time, so the record is
 * written on (source, externalRef) and a redelivery updates what is already
 * there. A ban listed twice is worse than one listed late.
 *
 * The reporter is also not allowed to file under `site`. That is what a
 * punishment an administrator issued here is called, and a module claiming it
 * would put its rows where a person's decisions are.
