/**
 * "Who is online" is a question about a handful of staff, not about every
 * session on the site.
 *
 * The route read every unexpired, unrevoked `UserSession` belonging to any
 * linked staff member and then threw all of it away but the user ids. That was
 * free while the table was empty - nothing wrote to it until sessions were
 * recorded at sign-in - and it is a row per login now, kept until the token
 * expires, which is thirty days for a session that ticked "keep me signed in".
 * A staff member who signs in twice a day for a month is sixty rows read to
 * answer one boolean about them.
 *
 * Asked from the staff side it is one query, bounded by the number of staff,
 * and the database does the existence check.
