/**
 * The staff module lists the team. It does not take applications.
 *
 * It used to do both: the public page carried an application form under the
 * team, the module shipped two endpoints and an admin screen to review what
 * came in, and a StaffApplication table to hold it. Applying to join a
 * community is its own thing - it has positions, questions, review states and
 * a conversation - and it is being built as its own module. Bolted onto the
 * page that shows who the team is, it was neither.
 *
 * This is the line, written down: the module that answers "who runs this
 * place" carries nothing that answers "can I join".
 *
 * The table itself stays behind on any install that already has it. Module
 * migrations are forward-only and additive, and uninstall leaves tables on
 * purpose; dropping this one would delete applications an operator may still
 * want to read.
