/**
 * A forum an operator closed is closed to search as well.
 *
 * `allowGuestView` decides whether the forum is a public shop window or a
 * members' room, and `denyGuestView` enforces it on every forum endpoint - the
 * rule's own comment says why it has to be the server that decides: the pages
 * are client components, so hiding a link would leave the JSON reachable by
 * anyone who typed the URL.
 *
 * Site search was the URL nobody typed. The provider repeated the moderation
 * rule and not this one, and its own comment claimed the general principle:
 * "a search result is a way into the content and not a lesser view of it".
 *
 * Measured against the running server before this was written. With
 * `allowGuestView` false and one approved topic:
 *
 *     GET /api/v1/forum/topics   403  "Sign in to view the forum"
 *     GET /api/v1/search?q=...   200  title, and the excerpt in full
 *
 * The excerpt is the first 140 characters of the topic, so the door beside the
 * closed one handed out the content itself, not merely its existence.
