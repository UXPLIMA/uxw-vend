/**
 * A private category has more than one door.
 *
 * The permission matrix is easy to apply on the page that lists a category and
 * easy to forget everywhere else, and forum topics are read in seven other
 * places: the topic list, one topic, the statistics, the site search, the
 * sitemap, a member's profile, and the moderation queue. A staff-only section
 * that is hidden on the forum page and named in the search results, or listed
 * in the sitemap for a crawler, is not hidden.
 *
 * It is the same failure every time and it never looks like one: the code that
 * leaks is a query somebody wrote before the permission existed, and it keeps
 * working perfectly.
 *
 * So there is one function that answers "which categories may this reader
 * see", and this holds every reader to going through it. A reader that must
 * not - the moderation queue exists to show what a moderator would otherwise
 * miss - says so by name, with the reason.
