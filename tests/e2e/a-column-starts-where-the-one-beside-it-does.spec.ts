/**
 * On a two-column page, both columns start at the same line.
 *
 * A section in the content column is a heading and then its cards; a widget
 * in the sidebar is a card with its heading inside. Left to themselves the
 * two columns begin at the same y, which puts every widget card a heading's
 * height above the cards it sits beside. It reads as crooked, and it is the
 * complaint that keeps coming back: the widget column floats.
 *
 * The homepage fixed it once, with `uxw-heading-spacer` and a comment naming
 * this file - which did not exist. So the rule was written down and never
 * held, and two more pages drifted out of line behind it. Measured at 1440px
 * on 2026-09-09: /wheel was 64px out (a wheel picker above the card) and
 * /help 44px (a section heading the sidebar had no answer for).
 *
 * Geometry rather than markup, because the thing under test is where the
 * boxes land, and a page may put them there any way it likes. A card is found
 * the way a reader finds one: the first box big enough to be one, with a
 * border and a background of its own.
