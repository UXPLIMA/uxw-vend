 * password unless `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set - hardcoding one here meant the
 * suite only ever passed against a developer's hand-made account, which is why
 * it could not run in CI. CI seeds with these same two variables.
 *
 * The fallbacks are what `prisma/seed.ts` makes when it is told nothing, and
 * `the-e2e-login-matches-the-account-the-seed-makes.test.ts` holds them to it.
 * They drifted once: the helper looked for `admin@uxwvend.com` while the seed
 * wrote `admin@example.com`, and a local run answered with twenty specs each
 * waiting fifteen seconds for a navigation that could never come.
 *
 * No fallback password can be right, because the seed's is random unless it is
 * told otherwise. What `login` can do is say so.
