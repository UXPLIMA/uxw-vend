# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
# Multi-stage build for uxwVend. Node 24 matches package.json engines.node.
#
# Stages:
#   deps    — install every dep (dev + prod) so the builder can compile TS.
#   builder — runs prisma generate + next build, produces .next + generated files.
#   runner  — minimal runtime with a non-root user and a HEALTHCHECK that
#             probes /api/health.
#
# Runtime notes:
#   - src/modules/ is NOT copied. The runner starts with zero modules
#     installed, matching the "fresh install" motto. An admin installs
#     modules from module-marketplace/*.zip via the admin UI after boot.
#   - HEALTHCHECK uses wget (Alpine ships BusyBox wget) to hit the probe
#     endpoint — any 200/degraded response keeps the container healthy.
#   - The runner can re-run `next build` in place (on module install, and at
#     boot via scripts/reconcile-build.ts). Everything `next build` reads must
#     therefore be present in this stage, not just what `next start` reads —
#     that is why postcss.config.mjs and src/instrumentation.ts are copied
#     below. Omitting postcss.config.mjs is silent: the rebuild succeeds and
#     ships a stylesheet that Tailwind never processed.

# so the hook resolves, and set the flag so it exits immediately: everything
# it would do (merge-schemas, generate-theme-registry, generate-registry) the

# `npm prune --omit=dev` at the end drops the test and lint toolchain (vitest,
# playwright, jsdom, eslint and their trees) from the node_modules the runner
# inherits. It can only drop that much because the packages the *runtime* build
# needs — typescript, tailwind, tsx, prisma, dotenv, the @types, and the
# bundle analyzer next.config.ts imports at the top level — are declared
# as real dependencies rather than devDependencies. That is not bookkeeping:
# this image rebuilds itself when a module is installed, so those packages are
# needed in production, and calling them "dev" was the inaccurate part.
# `node_modules/.prisma` survives: npm skips dot-prefixed entries.
