/**
 * Additive-only schema sync.
 *
 * The problem this exists to solve: installing a module at runtime has to
 * create that module's tables, and `prisma db push` - the tool the design
 * originally reached for - cannot do that safely on a live database.
 *
 * `db push` reconciles the whole database to the merged schema, which means it
 * also removes anything the schema no longer declares. Uninstall deliberately
 * leaves a module's tables in place so a reinstall does not lose the admin's
 * data (see the comment in `src/app/api/v1/modules/[id]/route.ts`), so after
 * any uninstall the database legitimately holds tables the schema does not
 * mention. Both of `db push`'s answers to that are wrong:
 *
 *   - the leftover table is empty  → it is dropped, silently, exit 0. The
 *     "preserved for reinstall" promise is quietly broken.
 *   - the leftover table has rows  → the push refuses outright
 *     ("Use the --accept-data-loss flag"), so the module being installed
 *     never gets its tables either.
 *
 * Both were reproduced against a real install before this script existed.
 *
 * So: ask Prisma for the diff rather than letting it apply one, and run only
 * the statements that add. `prisma migrate diff --script` annotates every
 * statement with the operation that produced it (`-- CreateTable`,
 * `-- DropTable`, `-- AlterTable`, …), so the filter reads those annotations
 * instead of parsing SQL. Anything not provably additive is skipped and
 * named in the log - destructive and altering changes are what a module's
 * `migrations/` directory is for, and `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` says so.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/apply-schema-additions.ts             # apply
 *   npx tsx scripts/apply-schema-additions.ts --dry-run   # print the plan
