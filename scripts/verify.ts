/**
 * Run what CI's check job runs, in one command.
 *
 * The list a contributor is likely to run from memory is shorter than the one
 * CI runs, and the difference has cost real commits: `check-marketplace-sync` and `npm audit` are in
 * nobody's habit, and `test:coverage` enforces per-file thresholds that plain
 * `npm test` leaves as decoration. A push is a slow way to find that out.
 *
 * It runs every gate rather than stopping at the first failure, because the
 * question at the end of a change is "what is broken", not "what broke first".
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 *   - It does not reseed `src/modules` from `module-sources` the way CI does.
 *     On a fresh checkout that directory is empty and CI has to fill it; on a
 *     developer's machine it is their install state, and overwriting it would
 *     discard a module they installed to test against.
 *   - It builds into `.next-prod`, not `.next`, so a dev server on 3001 keeps
 *     its cache and keeps serving. Next writes its own directory into
 *     `tsconfig.json` on the way through, so that file is put back afterwards.
