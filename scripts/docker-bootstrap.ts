// Docker database bootstrap AND upgrade.
//
// Run by the `migrate` service in docker-compose.yml before the app starts,
// on every `up`. It has two jobs, decided by whether the core `User` table
// already exists:
//
//   FRESH database  - merge schemas, push, and seed the 3 roles + core
//                     permissions + admin user, so `install.sh` yields a
//                     working login out of the box.
//
//   EXISTING database - run the upgrade sequence documented in
//                     docs/DEPLOYMENT.md ("Upgrades") and docs/MIGRATIONS.md:
//                     merge-schemas -> apply-schema-additions -> db push ->
//                     apply-migrations. It used to return early here, which
//                     meant pulling a newer image left the database on the old
//                     schema: the install was one command, the upgrade was
//                     silently broken. Seeding is NEVER repeated.
//
// merge-schemas reads src/modules, so the `migrate` service mounts the same
// `modules` volume the app does - otherwise the merged schema would be
// core-only and `db push` would try to drop every table the installed
// modules own.
//
// If any step fails the service exits non-zero and the app never starts
// (`depends_on: service_completed_successfully`). That is deliberate: a
// running app on a mismatched schema is worse than a stopped one.

// Reads DATABASE_URL from .env - this script is run directly via tsx,
// outside Next.js, which is what normally loads the env file.

/**
 * `prisma db push` on an existing database, tolerating exactly one failure:
 * its refusal to drop something that has rows in it.
 *
 * Uninstalling a module deliberately leaves its tables in place so a
 * reinstall keeps the admin's data. `db push` wants to remove every table the
 * merged schema no longer declares, and when one of them is not empty it
 * stops with "Use the --accept-data-loss flag" and a non-zero exit. Treating
 * that as fatal - which it was - means an operator who ever uninstalled a
 * module with data in it cannot start the app again after an upgrade: the
 * migrate service fails, and `depends_on: service_completed_successfully`
 * keeps the app down with it.
 *
 * The additive half of the same reconciliation has already run by this point,
 * so the schema is current in every direction that matters; what push would
 * still have done is drop things, and declining to drop them is the safe
 * outcome. Every other push failure stays fatal.
