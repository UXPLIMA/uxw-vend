 * Tests for a module live in `tests/modules/<moduleId>/` and import the module
 * as `@/modules/<id>/...`, which is where an *installed* module lives.
 *
 * The platform ships with zero modules, so `src/modules/` is normally empty,
 * and a test importing a module that is not installed cannot even be
 * transformed - it fails at collection, not as an assertion. This used to be
 * handled by only including the tests of installed modules, which kept a
 * clean checkout green and quietly created a hole: CI copies every module
 * into `src/modules` before it runs, so it ran a hundred tests that no
 * developer machine did. Three of them were red for weeks - a mock missing an
 * export the route had gained, a mock missing a method, a test still mocking
 * the path its module had stopped importing - and every one of them was
 * invisible to `npm test` here.
 *
 * So the tests all run, everywhere, and a module that is not installed
 * resolves to the sources the marketplace ZIPs are built from. `src/modules`
 * still wins when it has the module, because that is the copy the running app
 * would load.
