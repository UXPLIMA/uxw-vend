/**
 * The article filter every public door applies.
 *
 * Six reads spelled it for themselves and they did not agree. The API list,
 * the search provider and the sitemap tested three things; the article's own
 * page, the blog listing and the route resolver tested two, leaving out the
 * `publishAt` check - so the door that shows the whole article was the loosest
 * of them. The sitemap's own comment even said the page applied that test,
 * which had stopped being true.
 *
 * Two more doors never spelled it at all: creating a comment looked the
 * article up by id and checked only that a row came back, and listing comments
 * narrowed on the comment's own moderation state and never on the article's.
 *
 * A stranger does not guess a cuid, so the way in is an article that was
 * published and then pulled back to a draft: its id and slug were public while
 * it was up, and afterwards the page said it was gone while the comment
 * endpoints went on serving and accepting.
 *
 * One definition, so the next door added is one import rather than one more
 * chance to spell it differently. `new Date()` is evaluated per call because a
 * scheduled article becomes visible with the clock, not with the process.
