/**
 * How a punishment gets in here from somewhere else.
 *
 * This module owns the record: what a member has been punished for, by whom,
 * until when. It used to own the ingest too - one API key, one payload shape,
 * one game server's plugin - which made a module called "Punishments" a
 * mirror of one particular piece of software.
 *
 * So the ingest moved out and this became a socket. A module that watches a
 * game server, a chat platform or anything else that bans people asks
 * `punishment.record`, and this module writes the row. The asker never
 * touches the table, and the row is the same shape whoever it came from.
 *
 * The contract lives here even though this module answers rather than asks,
 * for the reason the store's payment contract does: every recorder depends on
 * this module, so this file is always there, and one published shape beats
 * each of them inventing their own.
