/**
 * The footer's currency picker.
 *
 * It used to write the visitor's choice into a React context defined inside
 * this module, which no page outside this module could import. The store and
 * the leaderboard each shipped their own copy of that context, neither of
 * them mounted, so every price on the site was drawn by the copies' default
 * formatter: a dollar sign glued to an unconverted number. Picking a currency
 * here changed nothing anywhere.
 *
 * Core owns the price formatter now. This module still owns the rates: it
 * hands core a code and how many of that currency one unit of the site's own
 * currency buys, and every price on the site follows.
