/**
 * Answers the `server.command` filter: this module can reach game servers, so
 * it runs the command and reports what happened.
 *
 * A failure comes back as a value rather than an exception. The callers are
 * mid-checkout - a thrown error here would turn "the delivery command was
 * refused" into "the order failed", which is the wrong outcome for a payment
 * that already went through.
