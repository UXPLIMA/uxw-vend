 * having on a site with only a store, or only a forum. Prisma's generated
 * client carries a model only while the module that declares it is installed,
 * so asking for `_count: { topics: true }` outright makes the whole route a
 * compile error on every install without a forum, and asking through a
 * relation Prisma has never heard of is a runtime validation error rather than
 * a zero.
 *
 * Each optional total is therefore counted on its own model, and a model that
 * is not there counts zero.
