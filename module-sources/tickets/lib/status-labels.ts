/**
 * The label for a ticket's status or priority, in the reader's language.
 *
 * Both are Prisma enums, so what the database holds is `IN_PROGRESS` and
 * `URGENT`. The ticket list on the public side worked this out and mapped
 * them to message keys; the ticket detail page beside it, and both admin
 * screens, printed the enum instead - a Turkish visitor read "WAITING_REPLY"
 * where a status belonged, and the same page said "Oncelik: HIGH". The maps
 * live here so the four screens cannot drift apart again.
 *
 * The `t.has` guard is deliberate: next-intl renders the key path rather than
 * throwing when a message is missing, so an unmapped value falls back to
 * something readable instead of to "tickets.inProgress".
