/**
 * Answers `store.orders.collect`: what this shop sold in a window.
 *
 * An accounting integrator asks the site for its sales between two dates.
 * Answering used to be the integrator's own job, with its own query against
 * `Order` - a module that files invoices knowing the shop's status
 * vocabulary, its line item columns and where the buyer's email lives.
 *
 * Paid orders unless the caller names another state, because an unpaid order
 * is not a sale and invoicing one is a document to cancel later.
