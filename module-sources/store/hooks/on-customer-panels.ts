/**
 * What the shop knows about one member, for the screen an operator opens when
 * somebody writes in.
 *
 * Counts and totals rather than rows: the panel sits beside four others and an
 * operator scanning it wants to know whether this is a customer who has spent
 * three hundred or one who has never bought anything. The link is how they get
 * to the detail.
 *
 * The words are translated here rather than sent as keys. This module knows
 * which catalogue they are in and the screen does not, and an `adm_` key sent
 * to a page is a key that page never receives - core strips them from what a
 * public catalogue carries.
