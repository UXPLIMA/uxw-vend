/**
 * When a product is for sale, and what it costs while it is.
 *
 * The shop had one switch per product - active or not - so every shape a
 * community actually sells needed a person watching a clock: a seasonal pack
 * switched on by hand on the 20th, a Friday evening offer somebody had to be
 * awake for, "one per account" enforced by reading the orders afterwards and
 * apologising.
 *
 * Four rules live here: a run between two dates, a weekly window, a limit per
 * person, and an allowance that refills. Each is asked in three places - the
 * list that decides what to draw, the button that decides whether to offer,
 * and the checkout that decides whether to take the money - so they are one
 * function. The third is the one that matters; the first two are a courtesy,
 * and a limit enforced only in a browser is not a limit.
 *
 * Every hour here is the site's own clock. "Friday at 18:00" is not a moment
 * until somebody says whose, and the only answer that starts a limited run at
 * the same instant for everybody is the operator's.
