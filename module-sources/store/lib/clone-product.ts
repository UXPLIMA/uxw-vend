/**
 * Copying a product, and what a copy is not allowed to inherit.

 * wants four more of it at four prices. Typing it out again is where the
 * fourth one loses a delivery command nobody notices until somebody pays.
 *
 * The list of columns below is written out rather than spread from the source
 * row, because the failure this file exists to prevent is a column added to
 * the product a year from now and silently carried into every copy. A spread
 * copies whatever appears; a list copies what somebody decided to copy, and a
 * new column that belongs in a copy is one line here.

 * here would put the database in a file that has no business knowing about it.
