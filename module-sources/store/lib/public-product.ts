/**
 * What a shopper's browser is given about a product.
 *
 * Named rather than taken from the schema, because the answer is public and a
 * shared cache holds it: without this, a column added to `Product` tomorrow is
 * published to a CDN the day it is added. `deliveryData` is the reason it
 * matters today - an operator-authored blob nothing in the product reads back,
 * so whatever an operator writes there was being served to anyone who asked.
 *
 * `isActive` is here although a public read only ever returns `true`: the page
 * declares it, and dropping a field the client names is a separate change.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in either route because the listing and the page
 * have to publish the same shape - a product that gains a field by being
 * opened is a bug report waiting to be written.
