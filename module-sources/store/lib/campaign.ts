/**
 * A campaign: one price change, many products, opening and closing by itself.
 *
 * Every rule a campaign needs already exists per product - a weekly window, a
 * sale price, an allowance that refills - and setting them ten times by hand
 * is how a shop ends up with nine products on offer and one that was missed,
 * and then with nine that never came off. The campaign is the missing noun:
 * name it once, list what is in it, and it turns itself on and off.
 *
 * It borrows the product's own window rule rather than repeating it. Two
 * implementations of "does this wrap past midnight" is one of them shutting a
 * shop in the middle of its own event.
