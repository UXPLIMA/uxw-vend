/**
 * Taking a limited product off the shelf, and putting it back.
 *
 * `Product.stock` is edited on the admin form, rendered on the product page and
 * checked when an item goes into a cart, and until this file existed nothing
 * ever subtracted from it: a shop with one of something sold it to everyone who
 * asked. `null` means the shop does not count that product, and a null is never
 * written to - the difference between "unlimited" and "none left" is the whole
 * meaning of the column.
 *
 * The take is a conditional update rather than a read and a write, for the
 * reason the credit balance at checkout gives: two settlements racing for the
 * last one both read the same number, and only a condition in the `where`
 * leaves the second with nothing to update. That is also what keeps the count
 * off negative numbers without a check that can be raced.
