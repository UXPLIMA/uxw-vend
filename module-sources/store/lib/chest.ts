/**
 * What a purchase remembers between being paid for and being claimed.
 *
 * Checkout asks a buyer for the name to deliver to, separately from the name
 * they signed in with, because those are different on every site that
 * delivers into a game. It collects the fields the product asks for at the
 * same time and hands both to delivery.
 *
 * A purchase that waits in the chest is claimed later, and none of that used
 * to be written down. Redeeming ran the product's commands with the account's
 * username - the one name checkout deliberately did not use - and with none
 * of the answers the buyer typed. The commands ran; they ran for the wrong
 * person.
 *
 * The fix is not a better fallback. There is no name in the session worth
 * guessing with, so when nothing was recorded and nothing was typed, this
 * says so and the screen asks.
