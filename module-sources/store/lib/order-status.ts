/**
 * What an order's status is called, in the reader's language.
 *
 * `OrderStatus` is a Prisma enum, so the column holds `IN` capitals. Three
 * screens printed that enum straight out: the admin order list, the admin
 * order detail, and the status dropdown that sets it - while five perfectly
 * good admin-scoped orderStatus messages sat in the manifest, in both
 * locales, referenced by nothing.
 *
 * The customer's own order tab was worse than untranslated. It mapped each
 * status to a `tab_orders_status*` key that the manifest never declared, and
 * next-intl renders the key path rather than throwing, so a customer's
 * completed order read "store.tab_orders_statusCompleted". Those five
 * messages now exist, and every lookup here goes through `t.has` so a status
 * added later degrades to the enum rather than to a key path.
