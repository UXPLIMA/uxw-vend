/**
 * What the category form holds, and where it writes.
 *
 * The screen could create and delete a shelf and never edit one, so a name
 * typed wrongly meant deleting the shelf - and every product's place on it -
 * and building it again. It also left the shelf gate settable through the API
 * alone: the column existed and no form could reach it.
 *
 * Creating and editing differ in exactly two things and both fail quietly.
 * The wrong address makes a second category that looks like a successful edit
 * until somebody counts them; the wrong verb sends a partial row to a route
 * that wanted a whole one.
