/**
 * What the campaign form holds, and what it sends.
 *
 * The form is a list of products with a price box beside each. An operator
 * ticks four, fills three prices and saves - and `Number("")` is 0, so the
 * fourth goes on sale for nothing. Nobody notices until the orders arrive.
 *
 * So a row without a price is not part of the campaign. Zero typed on purpose
 * still is: an operator can mean free, and the difference between meaning it
 * and leaving the box alone is exactly what this file is for.
