/**
 * One product as an operator needs to see it.
 *
 * The public endpoint at /api/v1/store/products/[id] publishes a named set of
 * columns and only products that are on sale, which is what lets a proxy hold
 * its answer. The edit screen needs the opposite of both: every column the
 * form has a field for, and above all the product that was just switched off,
 * since that is the one an operator opens.
 *
 * Those are two different questions, so they are two endpoints - the same split
 * the listing already makes. Keeping them in one meant the public route had to
 * look up a session to decide what to say, on the page every visitor asks for.
