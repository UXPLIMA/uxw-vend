/**
 * One product, on a shelf.
 *
 * There were two of these on the store page and they had drifted: one showed
 * the sale price and one did not, the badges sat between the price and the
 * link so a card with a badge pushed its own price down, and a fixed 176px
 * media box meant every image was cropped to whatever that happened to be.
 * Rows of them lined up only by accident.
 *
 * So: one card, and three decisions written down.
 *
 * The media is 2:1, which is the shape a rank banner or a crate render is
 * actually drawn in, and it is a ratio rather than a height so it holds at
 * every column count.
 *
 * The bottom row is pinned. Title and badges grow upward from a fixed floor,
 * so the prices in a row are on one line whatever the cards above them say -
 * the thing a shopper compares is the thing that lines up.
 *
 * Colour means one thing here: the price turns primary only when it is a sale
 * price. A card where every price is the accent colour is a card where the
 * accent says nothing.
