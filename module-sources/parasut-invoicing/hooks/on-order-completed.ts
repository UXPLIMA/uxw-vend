/**
 * A paid order becomes an invoice.
 *
 * The claim row goes in before the call, because this hook arrives more than
 * once in normal operation - a retried gateway callback, an operator marking
 * an order paid that a webhook was already settling - and a legal invoice
 * issued twice has to be cancelled by hand. `createMany` with `skipDuplicates`
 * against the unique key on the order is the claim: it either wrote the row
 * or somebody else already has it.
 *
 * An order that cannot be invoiced is recorded with the reason rather than
 * dropped. An operator installed this because they have to issue invoices, so
 * an order they cannot is the one thing they need to be shown.
