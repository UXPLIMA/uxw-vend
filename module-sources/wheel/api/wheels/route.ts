/**
 * The wheels this visitor can see, and what each of them will let them do.
 *
 * One answer rather than a list plus a probe per wheel: the page draws a
 * button per wheel and every one of them needs the same four facts - is it on,
 * may I turn it, when may I turn it next, and what does it cost.
 *
 * This used to answer two different shapes at one address, picked by whether
 * the reader was an administrator: a visitor got wheels with their prizes,
 * an administrator got the raw rows their editing screen wanted. The page
 * lists what is on the wheel, so an administrator opening /wheel got a
 * TypeError instead of a page. An administrator browsing the site is a
 * visitor; the screen that manages wheels asks /api/v1/wheel/admin/wheels,
 * which is a different question and says so in its address.
