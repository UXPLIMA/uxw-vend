 * Which ink a prize name can be read in, on the colour of its own slice.

 * 1.9:1, and the name of the prize is the one thing the wheel exists to say.
 *
 * White stays the wheel's ink wherever it can be read: black and white labels
 * mixed across one wheel reads as an accident rather than a decision. It
 * gives way only where white fails outright, which is 3:1 - AA for text this
 * size - and on that palette it is the yellows, the ambers and the mid greens
 * that fall below it.
 *
 * Choosing the better of two inks is not the same as passing AA: a mid grey
 * fails against both, and the colour is the operator's. It is the best either
 * choice can do.
 *
 * Anything that is not a hex colour gets white, which is what the wheel drew
 * before this existed: the colour field takes free text, and a label that is
 * hard to read beats a label that throws.
