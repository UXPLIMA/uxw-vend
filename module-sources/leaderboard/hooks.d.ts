/**
 * What a board is, and who fills it.
 *
 * This module used to query three tables it does not own: the shop's `Order`,
 * the forum's `ForumPost` and the vote module's `VoteLog`, each behind a "is
 * this model installed?" check. That is a module knowing the name of another
 * module's table and the shape of a feature it does not ship, and it meant
 * the only way to rank anything new was to edit this module.
 *
 * So the direction is the other way round now. This module owns the page, the
 * tabs and the ranking; a module that has something worth ranking answers the
 * filter and appends its board. A site with no shop installed has no "top
 * buyers" tab because nobody offered one, not because a check here failed.
