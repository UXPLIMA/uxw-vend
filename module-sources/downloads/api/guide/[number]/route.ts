 * One download, with its instructions.

 * break a link. A download with nothing in `details` has no page and answers
 * 404 here rather than serving a page that repeats the row in the list; the
 * same 404 covers one that has been switched off, so a visitor cannot read a
 * retired file's guide by guessing its number.
 *
 * The download count is not incremented here. This is somebody reading the
 * instructions, which is not the same as taking the file, and counting it
 * would make the number on the list mean two different things.
