/**
 * POST /api/v1/vote/record - record that this user voted on a site.
 *
 * This used to be `/claim`, and it moved credits: each site carried a reward
 * and voting paid it out. The module sends people to a server listing to
 * vote and nothing more now, so the payout, the credit transaction and the
 * dependency on the credits module are gone.
 *
 * The log itself stays. It is what the 24-hour cooldown is derived from, what
 * the leaderboard counts to rank voters, and what the trophy engine counts
 * for the "Voter" badge - none of which was ever about the reward.
