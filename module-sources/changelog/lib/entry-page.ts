/**
 * Which release entries have a page of their own, and how to reach one.
 *
 * The timeline is a list of releases and most of them are one line: a version,
 * a word about what changed, done. A few are not - a release somebody needs to
 * explain, with a screenshot of the new screen and the reason the third
 * attempt was the one that shipped. Those get a page.
 *
 * So the link is conditional. An entry with nothing more to say must not look
 * like it is hiding something: a title that is a link and leads to a copy of
 * the line above it is worse than no link, because a reader learns the links
 * are not worth following.
 *
 * The URL is built from `number`, which never changes, with the slug beside it
 * for a reader. Renaming a release rewrites the slug and every link already
 * shared still lands, the same way an article works.
