/**
 * What an operator is allowed to save as a source.
 *
 * `query.ts` refuses a table or column name that is not a plain name, and
 * says why at length: an identifier is the one thing SQL will not let you
 * bind, so whatever goes there is concatenated, and refusing is the only thing
 * you cannot get subtly wrong.
 *
 * This is the other end of that decision, and it asks the same function rather
 * than repeating the rule. A screen accepting a name the reader will refuse
 * stores a source that is listed, looks configured, and answers an error to
 * every visitor for ever - the operator finds out from a page rather than from
 * the form they filled in. Worse in the long run, a table full of names the
 * reader refuses is an invitation for somebody to "fix" the reader by escaping
 * them instead.
