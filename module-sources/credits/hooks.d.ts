/**
 * The credit contract.
 *
 * Anything on this site can put credits into an account, and none of it should
 * write a balance itself: an increment without the ledger row beside it in the
 * same transaction leaves a balance nothing accounts for, which is what a
 * credit history exists to prevent. So there is one door, and it is a filter
 * rather than an action because the caller needs the answer - a job that
 * cannot tell "awarded" from "already awarded" from "refused" has no way to
 * decide whether to try again.
 *
 * There are two doors, for two shapes of the same rule. `credits.award` is a
 * grant that stands on its own and must happen once. `credit.change` is a
 * movement inside a transaction the caller already has open, which is what a
 * spin, a purchase or a transfer needs: the credits and the thing they paid
 * for commit together or not at all. Both are written by this module and
 * nothing else touches the balance or the ledger.
