## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately through one of:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred) — open a draft advisory at
   <https://github.com/UXPLIMA/uxw-vend/security/advisories/new>.
2. **Email** — `siracozmen@protonmail.com` with the subject line
   `[SECURITY] uxwVend`.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if possible).
- Affected version / commit.
- Any suggested remediation.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours** and to provide a remediation
timeline after triage. Please give us a reasonable window to release a fix
before any public disclosure (coordinated disclosure).

## Scope

In scope: the core platform (`src/core`, `src/app`), first-party modules
(`module-sources/`), themes, the module/theme install pipeline, auth, RBAC,
the upload and webhook surfaces.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report those
upstream), issues that require a pre-compromised admin account, and findings
that depend on running with insecure non-default configuration (e.g.
`PAYPAL_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED=1`).

Also out of scope: **what an installed module can do.** Modules are compiled
into the same process as core and run with the same database credentials,
filesystem access and secrets. This is documented, deliberate, and not a
vulnerability — installing a module is equivalent to installing a dependency,
and the manifest's `permissions` key is UI metadata, not an enforced boundary.
See [docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md](docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md) ("The trust model"). Reports about
the *install pipeline* — ZIP path traversal, manifest validation bypass,
privilege checks on the install routes — are firmly in scope.

## Hardening Notes

Production deployments should set `AUTH_SECRET`, `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and
`REDIS_URL` (required — without it the rate limiter fails closed and answers
429), and serve over HTTPS so the secure cookie prefixes activate. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
