/**
 * Which homepage widgets render, and in what order.
 *
 * Admin > Settings > Widgets writes two keys through `/api/v1/settings`:
 * `widget_visibility` (widget id -> boolean) and `widget_order` (widget ids,
 * first to last). The homepage honoured neither. `widget_order` was read by
 * no file in the repository, and `widget_visibility` never reached the
 * browser: the homepage reads it through `useSiteSettings`, which fetches
 * `/api/v1/public-settings`, and that endpoint publishes a fixed allowlist
 * that did not name either key. Hiding a widget and dragging one into place
 * both reported "saved" and left the page they configure exactly as it was.
 *
 * A manifest's `defaultVisible` was ignored for a third reason: the default
 * was hardcoded to visible rather than read from the declaration, so a module
 * that ships a widget switched off would have had it switched on.
 *
 * Both screens now go through here, so the customiser and the homepage cannot
 * disagree about what an unsaved widget does.
