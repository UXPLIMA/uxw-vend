/**
 * Where the mailer gets its transport and its return address.
 *
 * Two modules ship a screen for exactly these three values - a mail API key, a
 * return address and a display name - and nothing read the rows. An operator
 * pasted an API key into the admin panel, saw "Saved", and mail stayed off,
 * with the key now sitting in the database earning nothing. So the row is read
 * first and the environment variable is the fallback, which is the order an
 * operator expects: the image ships a default, the running site overrides it.
 *
 * Cached for a few seconds because every queued message asks. A save is not
 * required to take effect instantly; a mailer that opens a database
 * connection per message is a worse trade.
