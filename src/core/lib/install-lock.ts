/**
 * Module install lock + build queue.
 * Prevents concurrent installs from racing and ensures build runs only once
 * after all pending installs complete.
 *
 * Scenarios handled:
 * 1. Bulk install (37 modules) — build runs ONCE at the end, not 37 times
 * 2. Concurrent install requests — queued, not rejected
 * 3. Build already running — waits for completion
 * 4. Restart debounce — a single process replacement after the build
 * 5. Partial install failure — does not block other installs
 *
 * The lock itself is a Postgres advisory lock, so a second process — a
 * lingering old container during a deploy, or an operator running a script
 * against the same database — cannot start an install while one is underway.
 * The in-process flag is kept as a fast path so concurrent requests to this
 * process can early-reject without a round trip.
 *
 * Note that running two app processes permanently is not a supported topology
 * (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md, "The Build Lifecycle"): they would compile into the
 * same .next. The lock narrows the window, it does not make that safe.
