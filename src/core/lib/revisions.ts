/**
 * Generic content revision tracker.
 *
 * Modules call recordRevision() right BEFORE updating or deleting an entity
 * so the previous state is preserved. The (resource, resourceId) pair
 * identifies the entity; resource is a free-form string by convention
 * `<module>.<entity>`.
 *
 * Example usage in a PATCH route:
 *   const existing = await prisma.blogArticle.findUnique({ where: { id } });
 *   if (!existing) return notFound;
 *   await recordRevision("blog.article", id, existing, "update", session.user.id);
 *   await prisma.blogArticle.update({ where: { id }, data: ... });
 *
 * Listing is done by the admin screen through /api/v1/admin/revisions, which
 * pages across every resource. /api/v1/revisions answers for one entity and
 * has no caller in this tree.
 *
 * Nothing restores. The line here used to say "listing & restoring", and
 * `getRevision` sat below described as "for restore preview", read by its own
 * test and nothing else: a preview of something the product does not do. Both
 * are gone rather than left standing as a promise. A revision is a record of
 * what an entity was, and putting it back is a feature somebody would have to
 * decide on, not one to imply.
