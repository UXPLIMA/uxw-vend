/**
 * One request per URL per page, however many copies of the caller exist.
 *
 * Deduplicating with a module-level variable is the obvious way to write
 * this, and it holds exactly as long as the bundler keeps one copy of the
 * module. Code splitting does not promise that. Two chunks on the homepage
 * each carried their own copy of the settings hook, each with its own
 * "in flight" variable, so a hook written to fetch once fetched five times;
 * four store widgets in four chunks asked for the same totals fifteen times.
 *
 * The store therefore hangs off `globalThis` under a symbol: a second copy of
 * this file finds the same object rather than starting a private one.
 *
 * This is a read cache for GET traffic that several components happen to want
 * at the same moment. It is not a data layer: nothing revalidates, nothing
 * subscribes, and a mutation should call `invalidateShared` for the URLs it
 * affects.
