/**
 * Filesystem-aware half of manifest ref validation.
 *
 * Every path that accepts a module — marketplace install, ZIP upload, update —
 * has to confirm the files a manifest names are actually in the payload before
 * it commits anything to disk. Each of those three routes used to inline its
 * own copy of the check, and `scripts/validate-module.ts` (the CI gate) had a
 * fourth. The copies disagreed:
 *
 *   - The routes compared the ref to the disk verbatim, so a manifest saying
 *     `components/BlogNewsSection` was rejected even though
 *     `components/BlogNewsSection.tsx` sat right there — the extensionless
 *     form the registry generator not only accepts but strips down to.
 *   - The CI gate was extension-tolerant, but only for five of the twenty-one
 *     keys that can carry a ref, and it checked `routes`/`adminRoutes`/`api`
 *     verbatim.
 *
 * Between them, fourteen of the forty-two first-party modules passed CI and
 * were impossible to install. One resolver, used by all four callers, is what
 * keeps that from happening again.
