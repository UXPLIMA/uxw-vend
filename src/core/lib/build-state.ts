/**
 * Build-state reconciliation.
 *
 * uxwVend compiles module pages into the Next.js build, so `src/modules/` and
 * `.next/` have to agree with each other. Three events break that agreement,
 * and until this file existed all three broke it silently:
 *
 *  1. **An admin installs or removes a module.** `install-lock` rebuilds, but
 *     the running `next start` read its manifests at boot and keeps serving
 *     the old build until the process is replaced.
 *  2. **The operator runs `uxwvend update`.** A new image arrives carrying a
 *     `.next` built from zero modules, while the `modules` volume still holds
 *     the admin's modules - every installed module vanishes from the app.
 *  3. **A build is interrupted** (OOM, `docker kill` mid-install) and leaves
 *     `.next` matching neither the old nor the new module set.
 *
 * The fix is a fingerprint. After every successful build the module set is
 * hashed and written beside the build; at boot `scripts/reconcile-build.ts`
 * compares the hash against what is actually installed and rebuilds when they
 * disagree. The process therefore always serves a build that matches disk,
 * whatever happened while it was down.
 *
 * Two artifacts have to be reconciled, and they have different lifetimes:
 *
 *  - **The Next build** (`.next`) is a named volume in production, so it
 *    outlives the container.
 *  - **The generated Prisma client** (`node_modules/.prisma`) lives in the
 *    image layer, so it is reset to the image's copy every time the container
 *    is recreated - losing every module model that was generated into it.
 *
 * That difference is a bug generator: recreating a container left a build that
 * knew about the blog module and a Prisma client that did not, so every
 * module query failed with `Cannot read properties of undefined`. Each
 * artifact therefore carries its own marker, stored beside itself so it shares
 * exactly that artifact's lifetime.
 *
 * Known limit: the fingerprint covers each module's id, version and the bytes
 * of its `module.json`. Editing a module's *code* in place without touching
 * its manifest does not change the fingerprint. That is deliberate - install,
 * update and remove all go through the manifest, and hashing every file of
 * every module on every boot would cost more than it protects.
