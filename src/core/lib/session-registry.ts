 * token carries. Five places read that table: the profile's device list, the
 * two revoke endpoints, the `jwt` callback's revocation check, and the staff
 * module's "who is online". Nothing wrote to it. The row was never created, so
 * the list was empty for everyone, both revoke buttons updated zero rows, and
 * `isRevoked` could not become true no matter what a user clicked.
 *
 * Both calls here are best-effort on purpose. A device record is not what the
 * user asked for when they signed in, and refusing the sign-in because the
 * write failed would turn a degraded feature into an outage. A failed write is
 * logged as an error rather than a warning, because the user walks away
 * holding a session that "sign out everywhere" cannot reach.
