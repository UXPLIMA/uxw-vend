/**
 * Which algorithm hashes a password, and how the ones already hashed with the
 * other one keep working.
 *
 * An operator may choose. The list is short on purpose: bcrypt, which every
 * account on every existing install is already hashed with, and scrypt, which
 * is memory-hard and comes with Node rather than with a dependency. Nothing
 * weaker is on it - not because an operator would reach for MD5, but because
 * a dropdown is an endorsement, and a control that can silently make every
 * password on the site easier to crack is worse than no control. That is the
 * same rule the password minimum in `security-settings.ts` follows: an
 * operator may tighten, never loosen.
 *
 * Argon2id is the one this would otherwise offer. It is not here because
 * every Node binding for it is a native module, and a hashing algorithm that
 * fails to build is a site nobody can sign in to. That is a dependency
 * decision rather than a detail, so it stays a decision to be made rather than
 * one made quietly here.
 *
 * The whole risk of the feature is one sentence: changing the setting must not
 * lock anybody out. An account holds a hash made by whichever algorithm was
 * configured when its password was last set, and the setting is not a
 * migration. So a hash says what made it, verification reads the hash rather
 * than the setting, and the setting decides only what the next hash is made
 * with.
 *
 * The upgrade path is the login. A password exists in this process for exactly
 * one moment - when somebody types it - so that is the only moment an old hash
 * can be replaced. `needsRehash` marks the ones to rewrite then.
