 * Email broadcast helpers.

 * once per minute. It picks up status="queued" rows, fans out the email
 * to the recipients in batches with a small delay to respect rate limits,
 * and updates progress columns.
 *
 * Send via the existing core/lib/email.ts which delegates to the active
 * provider (resend-provider, etc.).

/**
 * Who a broadcast goes to, as a filter rather than as a list.
 *
 * It used to be a list. Queueing read every recipient row so it could write
 * `recipients.length`, and sending read them all again and held the array for
 * the whole run - which is minutes, because the loop waits 200ms between
 * batches of fifty. Measured for a hundred thousand recipients: 32.5 MB of
 * ids, emails and usernames held for six and a half minutes, and 150.6 MB at
 * half a million.
 *
 * The empty-email guard is here rather than in JavaScript after the fact, so
 * the number `queueBroadcast` writes is the number `processQueuedBroadcasts`
 * will actually send to. The column is `String @unique` and cannot be null;
 * this is the empty string a bad import can leave.
