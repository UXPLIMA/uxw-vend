 * Which rate-limit bucket a module endpoint gets.

 * Core's own routes each call the limiter themselves, which works because
 * there are ninety-seven of them and they all live in this repository. The
 * module surface is a hundred and sixty-five endpoints across fifty modules,
 * written by whoever wrote the module, and not one of them was limited: a
 * stranger could post to a form endpoint, a vote claim or a payment callback
 * as fast as the network allowed. Leaving it to each module to remember is
 * the bet that lost here, so the dispatcher applies this to all of them.
 *
 * A `providerCallback` gets a far higher ceiling than a browser endpoint: a
 * webhook throttled during a provider's burst delays a settlement, which is a
 * worse failure than the one the limit prevents. It is still a ceiling.

 * lists thirteen of its routes both bare and under `/store/`, and `servers`
 * and `player-profiles` each list one twice. The registry key is built from
 * the path, so each spelling opened its own budget and the ceiling on those
 * endpoints was quietly twice what it read as - measured on the demo, 120
 * requests to `/api/v1/store/widget-stats` exhausted that path and 30 more to
 * `/api/v1/widget-stats` from the same caller were all served.
 *
 * Two of them dispense value on request, `gift-codes/redeem` and `chest/[id]`,
 * and the dispatcher's whole reason for existing is that an endpoint may not
 * opt out of its limit. Keying on the handler makes an alias free: declare a
 * route under as many paths as you like, they share one budget.
 *
 * Falls back to the key for a route table generated before `handler` existed.
