 * Which rate-limit bucket a module endpoint gets.

 * Core's own routes each call the limiter themselves, which works because
 * there are ninety-seven of them and they all live in this repository. The
 * module surface is a hundred and sixty-five endpoints across fifty modules,
 * written by whoever wrote the module, and not one of them was limited: a
 * stranger could post to a form endpoint, a vote claim or a payment callback
 * as fast as the network allowed. Leaving it to each module to remember is
 * the bet that lost here, so the dispatcher applies this to all of them.
 *
 * A `providerCallback` gets a far higher ceiling than a browser endpoint: a
 * webhook throttled during a provider's burst delays a settlement, which is a
 * worse failure than the one the limit prevents. It is still a ceiling.
