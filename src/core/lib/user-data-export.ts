/**
 * GDPR-compliant user data export.
 *
 * Collects everything the platform stores about a user - the core tables
 * listed in CORE_TABLES below, plus a sweep of module-owned tables declared
 * by each module's `userDataExport` manifest entry.
 *
 * Per the core motto, this file does NOT hardcode any module model names.
 * It reads the generated `ModuleUserDataTables` registry (aggregated from
 * every installed module's manifest at build time), then probes the
 * runtime Prisma client for each entry - uninstalled modules simply
 * contribute nothing to the export without raising errors.
 *
 * Every core table names the columns it hands out. Prisma returns every
 * column when a query names no `select`, so an export written as a bare
 * `findMany` ships whatever the schema keeps for itself: this one shipped
 * `UserSession.tokenId`, the claim a JWT carries and the key a session is
 * looked up by when it is checked for revocation. Listing the columns also
 * means a column added to one of these tables later is withheld until
 * someone puts it here on purpose.

Contents
--------
  user-data.json   Structured dump of every row in our database that
                   references your account, grouped by source:

  user             Your profile row (password hash and 2FA secrets
                   are intentionally omitted).
  activityFeed     Public activity feed entries you generated.
  sessions         Login sessions (device, IP, last-active timestamp).
  warnings         Moderation warnings issued against you.
  notificationPrefs
                   Your per-channel notification preferences.
  revisions        Content revisions you authored.
  accounts         Sign-in providers linked to your account (provider
                   name and account id; the access tokens themselves
                   are omitted).
  apiKeys          API keys you created, by name and visible prefix.
                   The key itself is stored hashed and cannot be
                   handed back.
  media            Files you uploaded, with their public URLs.
  conversations    Direct-message threads you are a member of.
  messages         Direct messages you wrote. Replies from the other
                   side belong to their author and are not included.
  resourcePermissions
                   Per-account permission grants an admin recorded
                   against you, beyond what your role already allows.
  dashboardLayout  How you arranged the admin dashboard, if you are
                   an admin and ever changed it.
  auditLog         Security-relevant actions recorded against your
                   account, with the IP they came from. Details that
                   name another account are omitted.
  modules          Data owned by installed modules, grouped by module
                   (blog posts, forum topics, orders, tickets, votes,
                   linked game accounts, and so on). Only modules that
                   are currently installed on this instance contribute
                   data here.

Some rows are withheld on purpose: credentials that would still work
if they left our database, and fields that name somebody other than
you.

Your rights
-----------
Under GDPR and similar laws, you may also request permanent
anonymisation of your account ("right to be forgotten") from the
Privacy section of your profile page. That operation keeps your
public contributions (forum topics, blog posts, orders) but removes
your profile, sessions, and direct-message history.
