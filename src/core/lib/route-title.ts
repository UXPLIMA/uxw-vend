/**
 * The `<title>` core gives a page it renders on a module's behalf.
 *
 * A module page is a component in a registry, not a route segment file, so it
 * cannot export `generateMetadata`; core's catch-all does that for it. Core
 * used to build the title out of the last URL segment, which is right only
 * when the URL is known to name something real.
 *
 * On a route whose page resolves server-side and calls `notFound()`, it is:
 * the response is a 404 and Next replaces this metadata with the not-found
 * page's. On a route whose page answers 200 and renders "not found" in the
 * browser, it is not. `/store/product/999999/free-nitro-generator` came back
 * 200 with `<title>`, `og:title` and `twitter:title` all reading "Free Nitro
 * Generator" beside the site's own name, which is exactly what an unfurled
 * link shows in Discord or Twitter. Any visitor could mint one on the site's
 * domain. With `custom-pages` installed the route is `/[slug]`, so it was
 * every unrecognised URL on the site, not just the ones under a module.
 *
 * So a URL segment names the page only where a module has declared
 * `titleFromPath`, which `validate-module` grants only to a server page that
 * calls `notFound()`. Everywhere else the title comes from the route pattern
 * the module itself declared, which no visitor can influence.
 *
 * That pattern is a URL, and a URL is written once, in English. A Turkish
 * visitor reading "Mağaza" under an <h1> had "Store | uxwVend" in the browser
 * tab and in the search result, and `/store/vip` was titled "Vip", which is
 * not a word in either language. So a route may also declare `titleKey`, a
 * key into the translations the module already ships, and the humanized
 * segment becomes the fallback for a module that declares none.
