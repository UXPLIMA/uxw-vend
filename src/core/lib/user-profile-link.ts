/**
 * Where a username points, if anywhere.
 *
 * Core writes a username in a few places of its own - the activity feed on
 * the home page, the audit log - and linked every one of them to
 * `/profile/<username>`. That is not a route: `/profile` is the signed-in
 * visitor's own page and takes no segment, so every one of those links
 * answered 404. The name that hurt most was the activity feed's, which is on
 * the home page of every install that turned it on.
 *
 * Core cannot fix that by writing `/player/<username>` instead, because that
 * path belongs to a module that may not be installed. So the module that
 * serves profiles declares `userProfile: true` on the route, and core asks
 * the registry. With no such module, a username is text rather than a link to
 * nowhere.
