 * writes an intent into a directory shared with the `updater` service, the
 * updater does the work the `blysis update` command does, and writes its
 * progress back into the same file for the screen to show.
 *
 * That makes this file a boundary in both directions. What goes out must be
 * safe to hand to a process that pulls an image by name, so the tag written
 * here is the one the release feed gave, never one a request carried. What
 * comes back was written by another process and is rendered on an admin
 * screen, so it is parsed rather than trusted.
