 * Nineteen modules had written the same eight lines: pull the rows for a list
 * of keys, coerce each value to a trimmed string or null, fall back to an
 * environment variable. That was harmless duplication right up until the
 * values started being encrypted at rest, at which point every one of those
 * copies would have handed its provider a ciphertext and produced the worst
 * class of bug - a gateway rejecting the operator's key, which reads as "the
 * operator pasted it wrong" and is chased in the wrong place for days.
 *
 * So the read is one call. `secret-settings.ts` decides which values are
 * credentials, from what the modules themselves declared; this only knows how
 * to fetch a row and hand it over.
