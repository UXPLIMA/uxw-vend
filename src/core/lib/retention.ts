/**
 * Audit-log retention.
 *
 * Tables like ActivityFeedItem and Revision grow unbounded unless pruned.
 * `pruneOldRecords()` deletes rows older than the per-table retention window.
 * Called daily by the core scheduler.
 *
 * `CronRun` used to be swept here on the same premise and does not belong:
 * `jobKey` is its primary key and `claimJob` upserts on it, so it holds one
 * row per registered job and cannot grow past the number of jobs. What the
 * thirty day window actually reached was the row of a job that had not run in
 * that time, which is one whose module is switched off or one that runs
 * monthly, and deleting it took `lastStatus` and `lastError` with it. Those
 * are what the observability screen reads, so a job that failed and then
 * stopped running had its failure swept away by the daily tidy-up.
 *
 * Core's tables only. `WebhookLog` used to be pruned here too, guarded by an
 * `in prisma` check because it belongs to the `webhook-logs` module - and that
 * module has always run its own daily cron over the same table with the same
 * thirty day window, so core was doing a module's work twice a day while
 * naming a model it has no business knowing.
 *
 * `ActivityLog` is the table this file was written for and the one it did not
 * name. `logActivity` writes to it from sixty-two places - every admin
 * mutation the product makes - and until now nothing had ever deleted a row.
 * Measured in Postgres with its four indexes and the metadata the call sites
 * really write: 451 bytes a row, so a site taking five hundred admin actions a
 * day keeps about 82 MB a year and never gives any of it back. Its near-twin
 * `ActivityFeedItem` was pruned all along, which is how one word of difference
 * hid it.
 *
 * What a prune costs here is worth saying plainly: an entry older than the
 * window is gone, and with it who did what to which entity, from which
 * address. That is why it gets `Revision`'s window rather than the feed's -
 * the longest this file uses - and why the number is in one place, so an
 * operator who has to keep more can change one line.
 *
 * Retention windows (days):
 *   ActivityLog        365  (the admin audit trail)
 *   ActivityFeedItem   180
 *   Revision           365  (longer - it's a compliance/audit trail)
 *   UserSession         30  (past expiresAt OR revoked)
 *   VerificationToken   already expired
 *
 * Returns a summary of how many rows each table dropped so the cron log
 * is useful for ops.
