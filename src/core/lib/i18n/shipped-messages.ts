/**
 * The catalogue this version ships, as opposed to the one in the table.
 *
 * The table is the source of truth for anything an operator edited and for
 * every module, and a seeder copies these files into it on each boot. Between
 * a release and that seeder is a window where a string exists in the code and
 * not in the table, and every screen using one renders the key: the update
 * screen shipped reading `admin.updates_title` to anybody who opened it.
 *
 * Reading the file closes that window, and it answers a second question the
 * translation editor asks - what did this string say before anybody touched
 * it? That answer is what an edit is judged against and what reverting one
 * puts back.
