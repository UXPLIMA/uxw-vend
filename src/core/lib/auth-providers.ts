/**
 * Resolves the identity providers contributed by installed modules.
 *
 * Core ships no OAuth provider of its own. Each module declares one in its
 * manifest (`authProviders`), the registry generator collects those
 * declarations into `ModuleAuthProviders`, and this resolver turns them into
 * Auth.js provider instances.
 *
 * A declaration comes in one of two shapes:
 *
 * - **Built in** - `envIdVar` + `envSecretVar`. The id resolves as
 *   `next-auth/providers/<id>` and the provider gets a client id and secret.
 * - **Module supplied** - `factory` + `envVars`. The module built the provider
 *   itself, which is the only way to reach an identity system Auth.js does not
 *   ship, and receives the env vars it asked for.
 *
 * Both factory maps are emitted with static imports so the bundler resolves
 * exactly the providers installed modules asked for; a runtime
 * `require(`next-auth/providers/${id}`)` would instead drag in every provider
 * next-auth ships, including ones with optional native dependencies.
 *
 * Activation stays env-gated rather than reading `ModuleConfig.enabled`:
 * Auth.js builds its configuration synchronously at module load, long before a
 * database round-trip is possible. A module that is installed but has no
 * credentials configured therefore contributes nothing, which is the same
 * behaviour as before this became registry-driven.
