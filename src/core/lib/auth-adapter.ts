/**
 * The Auth.js database adapter, mapped onto core's `User` model.
 *
 * `@auth/prisma-adapter` assumes the schema Auth.js documents: a `User` with
 * `name` and `image` and nothing required beyond `email`. Core's user is older
 * than that and different - it has `username` (required and unique) and
 * `avatar`, and no `name`/`image` at all - so the stock adapter's
 * `user.create({ data: { name, email, image } })` cannot even be compiled by
 * Prisma, let alone succeed. Every first OAuth sign-in failed on it.
 *
 * So the stock adapter is wrapped rather than replaced: session, account and
 * verification-token handling are already right, and only the user half is
 * translated here.
 *
 * Three things are translated:
 *
 * - **`name` <-> `username`.** A display name is free-form and can repeat; a
 *   username is unique, so it is slugged and, on collision, suffixed. It is
 *   set once at sign-up and never overwritten afterwards, because the person
 *   (or an admin) may have changed it deliberately.
 * - **`image` <-> `avatar`.** A straight rename.
 * - **A missing email.** Several identity providers never hand one over
 *   (Battle.net, Epic Games, Kick, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, and X unless the
 *   app is approved for it), but `User.email` is required and unique. Those
 *   accounts get a placeholder in the `.invalid` TLD, reserved by RFC 6761 so
 *   it can never resolve or be delivered to. `emailVerified` stays null and
 *   nothing is ever sent to it; the user can set a real address from their
 *   profile.
 *
 * `linkAccount` is narrowed too: providers return extra fields at the token
 * endpoint (GitHub's `refresh_token_expires_in` is the usual one) and Prisma
 * rejects a create with a column it does not have.
