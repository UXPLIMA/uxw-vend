/**
 * What the sitemap and robots.txt agree to publish.
 *
 * Both files used to keep their own list, and they disagreed: the sitemap
 * submitted `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` while robots.txt disallowed
 * `/auth`, which is the shape Search Console reports as "indexed, though
 * blocked". They share the lists here instead.
 *
 * The other half of the problem was what the sitemap left out. Core ships no
 * pages of its own beyond the home and activity screens: on this platform the
 * content is the modules, and a module only reached the sitemap by declaring a
 * `seo` contributor, which none of the first-party ones do. Every static page
 * an enabled module routes is published now; a contributor is still how a
 * module adds the URLs core cannot know, like one per product.
 *
 * The third problem was the locale. Every route in this product lives under a
 * locale segment - `localePrefix: "always"` - so `/store` is not a page, it is
 * a 307 to `/en/store`. The sitemap published the bare paths, which made every
 * URL in it a redirect, and robots.txt disallowed bare `/admin`, `/auth` and
 * `/profile`, which are prefixes no crawlable URL on this site begins with. It
 * blocked nothing. Both are built from `localizedPaths` now.
