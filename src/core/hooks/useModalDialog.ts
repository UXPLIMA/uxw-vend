/**
 * The keyboard half of a dialog.
 *
 * `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"` is a promise to assistive
 * technology that the rest of the page is inert while the dialog is up.
 * Nothing in the DOM enforces that promise. Without a focus trap, Tab walks
 * straight out of the dialog and into the page behind the overlay, which is
 * still fully interactive and, to a sighted keyboard user, invisible: focus
 * lands on controls hidden under a black scrim. Without focus restoration,
 * closing the dialog drops focus on `document.body`, so the next Tab starts
 * over from the top of the page rather than from the control that opened it.
 *
 * Every dialog in the product carried the markup and only one carried the
 * behaviour, so this is that one implementation, moved somewhere the other
 * eleven can reach it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const dialogRef = useModalDialog(open, close);
 * return open ? <div ref={dialogRef} role="dialog" aria-modal="true">...</div> : null;
 * ```
 *
 * `onClose` is read through a ref, so passing an inline arrow does not tear
 * the listener down and set it up again on every render.
 *
 * A non-modal popover (a dropdown panel that leaves the page usable) wants
 * Escape and focus restoration but not the trap: pass `{ trapFocus: false }`.
 */

/**
 * Queried fresh on every Tab rather than once when the dialog opens: a dialog
