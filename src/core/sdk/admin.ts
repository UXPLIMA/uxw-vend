/**
 * Blysis module SDK - admin scaffolds.
 *
 * `AdminCrudPage` and `SettingsForm` render a complete list/create/edit screen
 * or a settings panel from a field description, so a module's admin route is
 * usually a manifest entry plus a few lines of configuration.
 *
 * Separate from `@/core/sdk/ui` so a public-facing module page never pulls the
 * admin scaffolds into its bundle.
