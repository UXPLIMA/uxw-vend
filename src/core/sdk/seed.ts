/**
 * uxwVend module SDK - demo data.
 *
 * A module that ships a screen ships the data that makes the screen worth
 * looking at. An empty install answers every question with "nothing here
 * yet", which is exactly the state nobody needs to test: it hides pagination,
 * ordering, truncation, empty-vs-failed, and every layout that only breaks
 * once a name is long or a list is forty rows deep.
 *
 * So a module may ship `seed.ts` beside its `module.json`, exporting `seed`.
 * `scripts/seed-demo.ts` finds it, works out what it depends on, and runs it
 * with a context that hands over the accounts, the randomness and the writer.
 *
 * Types only. The seed itself runs outside Next, under tsx, against the
 * merged Prisma client, and the one import here is erased at compile time -
 * so nothing in this file can reach a module's bundle.
