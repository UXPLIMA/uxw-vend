/**
 * What this installation calls itself.
 *
 * Six screens spelled the product's name into their markup - the four auth
 * pages, the password reset page and the admin rail - so every installation on
 * earth advertised the same brand on its own sign-in form, whatever the
 * operator had put in Settings. Renaming the product meant editing six
 * components, and the translation gates flagged each one as English copy,
 * which it was.
 *
 * `site_name` is already an operator setting and already public, so this reads
 * it. The fallback is a translated string rather than a constant: it is what
 * shows on an install that has not been through setup yet, and it is the one
 * place the shipped name belongs.
