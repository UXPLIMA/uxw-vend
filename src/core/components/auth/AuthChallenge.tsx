/**
 * Where a module gets to put a check in front of an auth form.
 *
 * Core renders this inside the login, register and forgot-password forms and
 * has no idea whether anything fills it. With no module installed the slot
 * has no contributions, this renders nothing, and `useAuthChallenge()` hands
 * the form an empty object that changes none of its behaviour.
 *
 * A module's slot component receives `action` (so one widget can behave
 * differently on login and register) and `onField`, and reports whatever it
 * needs the server to see. Core forwards the collected fields verbatim and
 * never looks inside them: naming them is the module's business, and a
 * second challenge module would simply add its own.
