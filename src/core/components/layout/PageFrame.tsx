/**
 * The shell every public page is drawn in.
 *
 * Each module used to write this by hand, and 31 hand-written shells drifted
 * the way hand-written things do: nine content widths between max-w-2xl and
 * the full container, a breadcrumb on nine pages of the 31, two page
 * backgrounds, and a couple of titles wearing an icon. Moving from Blog to
 * Trophies moved the left edge of the text, which reads as a different site
 * rather than a different page.
 *
 * Owning the measure here is what makes "one width" outlive the next module:
 * a page cannot set its own, because it never writes the element that would
 * carry it. The header sits above both columns for the same reason it is here
 * at all - a sidebar that starts level with the breadcrumb puts every widget
 * card a heading's height above the content it sits beside.
 *
 * Deliberately not "use client": rendered from a server page it stays on the
 * server, and rendered from a page that says "use client" it compiles with it.
 * Both kinds of page exist and both need the same frame.
