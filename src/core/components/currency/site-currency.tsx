/**
 * What money on this site is worth, and how to write it down.
 *
 * There used to be three answers and none of them was this one. Checkout
 * charges in the `default_currency` setting; the store's admin screens called
 * `formatCurrency(x)` with no arguments, which is USD in `en-US`; the admin
 * dashboard and the analytics charts glued a `$` on by hand. So a shop
 * charging in lira showed every order, product, coupon and gift code as
 * `$1,250.00`, and the buyer's own order history said the same. The number
 * was not converted either: it was the lira figure with a dollar sign.
 *
 * Two more copies of a `CurrencyProvider` sat in the store and the
 * leaderboard, each with its own `localStorage` key, and neither was ever
 * mounted - every `useCurrency()` in those modules fell through to a default
 * context whose formatter was `` `$${amount.toFixed(2)}` ``. Meanwhile the
 * currency module mounted a fourth provider, app-wide, that nothing outside
 * that module could import. Its footer selector changed a value no page read.
 *
 * Core owns the base currency because core owns the setting the payment
 * gateways charge in. It does not own exchange rates and does not want to:
 * a module that knows them calls `setDisplay({ code, rate })` and every price
 * on the site follows. `null` puts prices back in the base currency.
