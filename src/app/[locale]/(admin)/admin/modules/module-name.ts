/**
 * What a module is called, in the reader's language.
 *
 * A manifest's `name` and `description` are English, the way every string in
 * a manifest is. The module ships translations for them under
 * `admin.module_<id>_name` and `_description`, and there are two places to
 * read those from, because there are two kinds of row on this screen:
 *
 *   installed - its translations were seeded on install, so the catalogue in
 *   the browser has them and `t.has` finds them.
 *
 *   marketplace - nothing about it is installed, so nothing about it is in
 *   the Translation table. Its row carries its own `i18n` map, written into
 *   the index by build-marketplace.
 *
 * This is one of the few honest uses of a `t.has` guard: the key is built
 * from a module id core does not know.
