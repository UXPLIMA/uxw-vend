# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue/PR templates, Dependabot, and
  CodeQL scanning for the open-source release.
- Docker Compose now bootstraps the database (schema push + seed) on first boot
  via a one-shot `migrate` service, so `docker compose up` yields a working
  login out of the box.
- `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`, `DEMO_MODE`, and
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` documented in `.env.example` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- `trophies` module: ships with starter trophies that seed on first boot from
  within the module (no longer coupled to the core seed).

### Fixed
- Docker build no longer aborts: the builder and `postinstall` now call the
  correct `generate-theme-registry.ts` script.
- `npm run db:seed` on a fresh clone no longer references a module-owned model
  (core seed produces only roles + permissions + admin user).
- SEO `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml` now read the documented `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
  (falling back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) instead of silently defaulting to
  `localhost`.
- Marketplace ZIPs rebuilt from current sources.

### Security
- Admin update handlers (downloads, popups, staff) now validate input against an
  explicit allowlist instead of spreading the raw request body (mass-assignment).
- Store product/category descriptions and blog titles are sanitized at write
  time; JSON-LD output is escaped against `</script>` breakout.
- The discord-integration webhook sender enforces the same hostname allowlist as
  core; the punishments API key check is now constant-time.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial public release: modular, plugin-based platform with a marketplace of
  first-party modules and a schema-driven theme system.
